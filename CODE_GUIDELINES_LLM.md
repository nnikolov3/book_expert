# BASH Code Guidelines to LLMs

- Declare variables before assignment to prevent undefined variable errors.
- Use 'declare' outside functions and 'local' inside functions.
- Ensure global variables have "GLOBAL" in the name.
- Use explicit if/then/fi blocks for readability.
- Ensure all if/fi blocks are closed correctly.
- Use atomic file operations (mv, flock) to prevent race conditions in parallel processing.
- Avoid mixing API calls.
- Lint with shellcheck correctness.
- Use grep -q for silent checks.
- Check for unbound variables with set -u.
- Clean up unused variables and maintain detailed comments.
- Avoid unreachable code or redundant commands.
- Keep code concise, clear, and self-documented.
- Avoid 'useless cat'; use cmd < file.
- If not in a function use declare, not local.
- Use rsync, not cp.
- Initialize all variables.
- Code should be self-documenting.
- Flows should have solid but efficient retry logic.
- Do more with less. Do not add code for the sake of adding code; it should have clear purpose.
- No hardcoded values.
- DO NOT USE: if <cmd>; then. Instead, use output=\$(cmd); if \$output; then
- DO NOT USE 2>>"\$LOG_FILE"
- DO NOT USE ((i++)); instead use i=\$((i + 1))
- DO NOT IGNORE the guidelines
- AVOID Redirections 2>/dev/null
- Declare / assign each variable on its own line
- DO NOT USE "\$?" indirectly. Assign it.
- Sort variable assignments, try to put everything at the top
- Quote \"\$?\" 
- The configuration file variable should be readonly (-r) , the same as API keys
- Update the comments in the code to ensure clarity of intent.
- The captured exit $? codes should be read only
- COMMENTS SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED; INCONSISTENCIES SHOULD BE UPDATED WHEN DETECTED
