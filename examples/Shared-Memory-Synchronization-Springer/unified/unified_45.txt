The realm of nonblocking algorithms is a crucial area in concurrent programming, aiming to avoid the deadlocks and performance bottlenecks associated with traditional locking mechanisms. A key concept in this area is the implementation of a single-word atomic counter using the Compare And Swap, or C A S, primitive. This counter is essential for maintaining consistency across threads in a multithreaded environment.

The code snippet for the atomic counter depicts a `counter` class with an atomic integer member `c`. The `get` operation simply loads the current value of `c`, while the `set` operation stores a new value. The `increase` operation is where the C A S primitive is central. It reads the current value of `c` into `old`, computes a `new` value by adding the increment `v` to `old`, and then attempts to atomically update `c` to `new` only if its current value is still `old`. If the C A S fails, meaning another thread modified `c` between the read and the C A S attempt, the operation repeats until successful.

This retry loop is the hallmark of many nonblocking algorithms. The figure caption emphasizes that all updates to this atomic counter must be performed atomically to ensure consistent ordering across threads. The simplest nonblocking algorithms use the C A S and Load-Linked/Store-Conditional, or L L / S C, based fetch and phi constructs to implement methods that update a single-word object. An atomic counter, or accumulator, object, for example, might be implemented as shown in the figure.

Reads, or `get` operations, and writes, or `set` operations, can use ordinary loads and stores, though the stores must be write atomic to avoid causality loops. Updates similarly require that fetch and phi instructions be write atomic. Note that in contrast to the lock algorithms of Chapter four, we have chosen not to avail ourselves of the default R W phi R W ordering on synchronizing instructions. This is appropriate, for example, in programs that only look at the value of a counter at the end of the computation.

If calls to `get`, `set`, or `increase` need to be ordered with respect to preceding or following operations in the calling thread, that is, if they need to be not only atomic but also linearizable, then the programmer will need to insert explicit fences. The discussion then moves to the Treiber stack, a lock-free stack implementation. It references the original work by Treiber in nineteen eighty-six for the I B M System thirty-seven, highlighting its widespread use.

The stack employs a top-of-stack pointer and a sequence count embedded within it. This sequence count is vital to avoid the A B A problem, a common pitfall in nonblocking data structures. The A B A problem occurs when a memory location's value changes from A to B and then back to A before a thread can perform a C A S operation. If the thread only checks for A, the C A S might incorrectly succeed, leading to corrupted state.

Without the sequence count or an alternative A B A solution, such as the one proposed by Jayanti and Petrovic in two thousand three, the stack would not function correctly. The importance of write atomicity is further underscored by its role in ensuring that modifications to a data structure are either fully applied or not applied at all from the perspective of other threads, preventing partial or inconsistent views of the data.

This principle is critical for maintaining the correctness of concurrent computations, especially when dealing with complex data structures and operations that involve multiple memory accesses. The Treiber stack's `push` operation takes a node pointer `n` as input and employs a `repeat` loop, indicating an iterative process that continues until a specific condition is met. Inside this loop, it first performs an atomic load operation on the `top` field.

The `pop` operation, returning a `node` pointer, also uses a `repeat` loop. It atomically loads the `top` pointer and its count. If the loaded `top` is null, it signifies an empty stack, and the operation returns null. Otherwise, it sets a local variable `n` to the node pointed to by the current `top`. It then proceeds to attempt an atomic Compare And Swap operation on the `top` field.

The concept of Memory Management is then discussed in relation to these data structures. It posits a scenario where the Treiber stack is modified to pass a `value` rather than a node, and to allocate or free nodes explicitly. If a node were deallocated and then reused by unrelated code, a potential issue arises. A `type-preserving allocator` is introduced as a solution, ensuring that a block of memory, once freed, is only reused for objects of the same type and alignment.

This drastically reduces the likelihood of the A B A problem by ensuring that if a memory address is reused, it's for an object of a compatible type and purpose. With such an allocator, a counted pointer will still increment its count if the underlying pointer value is reused, but the type-preserving nature of the allocator means that the new object at that address is semantically equivalent in its role within the data structure, thus preserving correctness.

The section then presents a simple type-preserving allocator as an example of its application. In this context, the Treiber stack is used as a free list. Old nodes, when freed, are pushed onto this stack. New nodes are obtained by popping from the stack. This strategy avoids cache misses by keeping frequently used nodes readily available.

A more sophisticated implementation involves thread-local pools of free nodes, managed by a memory manager. When a thread's local pool is empty, it obtains a batch of nodes from a central backup pool. This approach optimizes memory allocation and deallocation by reducing contention on a single global free list and improving cache locality.

The concept of nonblocking algorithms, particularly as applied to linked lists, is illustrated through the atomic update of a singly linked list. Figure eight point three presents a series of diagrams depicting insertion and deletion operations. Diagram (a) shows a naive insertion into a singly linked list, where a new node is intended to be inserted between nodes containing values twenty and thirty.

Diagram (b) illustrates a naive deletion operation, aiming to remove the node with value twenty-five. The critical challenge arises when these operations are executed concurrently. The text explains that a naive concurrent insertion and deletion can lead to an inconsistent state, as depicted in diagram (c).

This inconsistency stems from the potential for a race condition where one thread might modify a pointer while another thread is attempting to read or update it. For instance, if a deletion operation proceeds by first marking a node for deletion and then updating its predecessor's pointer, and concurrently an insertion operation tries to update the pointer of the node being deleted, the list's integrity can be compromised.

The Harris and Michael list approach addresses this by employing a two-step deletion process, as shown in diagram (d). This process typically involves first logically marking the node for deletion, often by modifying its value or a specific flag, and then retrying the pointer update if necessary. This retrying mechanism is crucial for maintaining correctness in the face of concurrency.

The atomic Compare-And-Swap, or C A S, operation is fundamental here. C A S is an indivisible machine instruction that atomically reads a memory location, compares its current value with an expected value, and if they match, writes a new value to that memory location. This primitive allows threads to attempt updates optimistically and retry if a conflict is detected.

The text further delves into the complexities of memory management in the context of concurrent data structures, specifically mentioning type-preserving allocators. Initialization of a newly allocated object must be carefully handled to avoid data races. If a thread accesses an object before its initialization is complete, or if another thread's access interferes with initialization, it can lead to incorrect behavior.

The use of explicit synchronizing stores is often required in languages like C++ to ensure proper memory ordering and prevent such races. However, relying solely on a type-preserving allocator can sometimes be undesirable, as it might prevent memory from being released to the operating system for the duration of a program's execution.

Alternative approaches for memory management in concurrent scenarios include reference counting, hazard pointers, and epochs, which are discussed in more detail in Section eight point seven. Singly linked lists are fundamental data structures, widely used as simple sets and as building blocks for more complex structures like hash tables and skip lists.

The ability to manipulate these structures in a lock-free fashion, meaning without requiring exclusive locks that can lead to contention and deadlock, is a significant area of research. Implementing lock-free insertion and deletion for singly linked lists, while seemingly straightforward, presents subtle challenges. Specifically, both insertion of a new node and removal of an existing node necessitate changes to the pointers of adjacent nodes.

Consider the insertion of a node with value twenty-five into a list where the node containing twenty points to the node containing thirty. In a naive implementation, a thread might attempt to update the pointer of the node containing twenty to point to the new node, and then update the new node's pointer to point to the node containing thirty.

If a concurrent deletion operation is in progress, it could interfere with this sequence, potentially leading to data loss or corruption. The H&M list, through its atomic operations and careful sequencing, aims to mitigate these issues. The text highlights that in Figure eight point three a, insertion of a node requires swinging the next pointer of the preceding node.

Similarly, deletion requires updating the pointer of the node preceding the one to be deleted. The use of C A S for these pointer manipulations ensures atomicity, preventing race conditions during these critical updates. The core principle is to make the modification of a node's pointer an atomic step, ensuring that no other thread can observe an intermediate, inconsistent state of the list.
