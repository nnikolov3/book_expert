Seven point four Other Language Mechanisms. The discussion revolves around advanced language constructs designed to manage concurrency and parallelism efficiently. One key concept is the implementation of a bounded buffer using conditional critical regions. A bounded buffer is a data structure that acts as a queue with a fixed capacity, and its implementation is crucial in concurrent programming for managing shared resources.

The code snippet provided illustrates the implementation of a buffer class with methods for insertion and removal of data. The buffer has a fixed size, defined by the constant SIZE, and two indices, next_full and next_empty, which track the next available slot for insertion and the next element to be removed, respectively. The insert method places data into the buffer at the next_empty index and updates next_empty using a modulo operation to wrap around the buffer. The remove method retrieves data from the buffer at the next_full index, updates next_full, and returns the retrieved data.

The accompanying text discusses the challenges of concurrency and how certain language constructs can mitigate them. Without restrictions, threads might race to enter regions of code associated with an object, leading to unpredictable behavior. To address this, sophisticated systems can track which variables a condition depends on and only switch into a thread when one of these variables changes value, potentially allowing the condition to become true. This optimization is more efficient than constantly re-checking all conditions, especially when the overhead of determining which conditions to check is low.

Another cost-reduction strategy involves requiring conditions to depend solely on the state of the lockable object itself, rather than on parameters passed to methods. These rules enable an implementation to associate each condition with a specific context, avoiding the need to restore the complete referencing environment of any particular thread. When a thread exits a region, another thread can be resumed if its associated condition is met. The importance of ensuring that condition tests do not race with updates to the variables they depend on is highlighted, and this property can be achieved by allowing conditions to depend only on the state of the lockable object or perhaps on parameters passed by value.

The concept of futures is also introduced as a mechanism for handling asynchronous computation. Futures allow for the deferral of evaluation, enabling computations to proceed in parallel. This is particularly useful in languages that support speculative execution or lazy evaluation, where a computation can be initiated and its result can be retrieved later when needed, without blocking the main execution flow. The use of futures in recursive algorithms, such as quicksort, is demonstrated, where subproblems can be delegated to futures, allowing for parallel execution.

Furthermore, the discussion touches on the implementation of futures in various programming languages, including Java, where a future can be created using a FutureTask, and its value can be retrieved using the get method. The importance of ensuring safe execution of futures in non-functional languages like Java is emphasized, and proposals for making futures safe in all cases, using techniques reminiscent of transactional memory, are mentioned.

The section then transitions to series-parallel execution as an alternative to spin-based synchronization mechanisms. Instead of busy waiting, scheduler-based synchronization allows threads to yield control when a condition is not met, effectively placing themselves in a waiting queue. This process can involve signaling or interrupts to wake up waiting threads. The text highlights that scheduler-based implementations are often found in systems utilizing series-parallel execution, a paradigm where computations are structured as a series of parallel tasks.

A code snippet illustrates a typical series-parallel loop construct, reminiscent of the Cilk runtime system. The structure involves a 'do' loop that iteratively spawns 'n' threads, with each iteration representing a parallel task. Following the loop, a 'sync' operation serves as a synchronization point, ensuring that all spawned threads complete their execution before the program proceeds. The loop continues until a termination condition is met.

Conceptually, this code represents a pattern where a primary thread forks 'n' child threads at the beginning of a loop iteration and then joins them at the end. The Cilk runtime system is noted for its efficient implementation of 'spawn' and 'sync' operations, aiming for minimal overhead. The text further explains that such tasks are often managed by a collection of worker threads, with the workload distributed through techniques like work stealing.

The discussion elaborates on how various programming languages and libraries provide mechanisms for parallel loop execution. For instance, Cilk++ supports 'parallel for' loops, where execution proceeds logically in parallel, and an implicit synchronization occurs at the end of such loops, ensuring all iterations complete before the program moves past the loop construct. This synchronization functionality can be integrated into existing languages through library routines, such as parameterized lambda expressions or compiler extensions like pragmas in OpenMP.

The concept of a "work stealing queue" is fundamental to many parallel runtime systems, where worker threads maintain their own queues of tasks. When a thread finishes its current task, it attempts to steal a task from the queue of another busy thread, helping to keep all available processors utilized and maximizing throughput. The efficiency of Cilk's 'spawn' and 'sync' operations contributes to the viability of this approach.

The text also touches upon the importance of proper synchronization to avoid data races, which occur when multiple threads access shared memory without proper control, leading to unpredictable program behavior. Barrier synchronization, as implied by the 'sync' statement, ensures that all threads reach a certain point in execution before any thread can proceed, maintaining program correctness in parallel environments.

Finally, the discussion extends to how series-parallel execution is supported in languages like Fortran, which offers constructs such as the 'forall' loop for parallel iteration. The presence of features like compiler or preprocessor directives, as seen in OpenMP, demonstrates the evolution of programming language support for parallel and concurrent computation, aiming to abstract away much of the low-level synchronization complexity for the programmer.
