The discussion centers on atomic primitives, fundamental constructs in concurrent computing that guarantee operations on shared memory locations appear to occur instantaneously and indivisibly, even in the presence of multiple concurrently executing threads. This atomicity is critical for maintaining data integrity and correctness in parallel systems.

The `fetch and Phi` operation exemplifies a generalized atomic read-modify-write primitive. Its essence is to atomically read a value from a memory location `w`, apply a function `Phi` to that value, and then atomically write the result back to `w`. The designation "nonblocking" implies that, when implemented using mechanisms like `Compare And Swap`, no thread can indefinitely halt the progress of other threads, a property known as lock-free progress. This is a crucial distinction from traditional locking mechanisms, where a thread holding a lock can stall all other threads waiting for that lock.

One common architectural approach to implementing such atomic primitives is through the `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` instruction pair. The `Load Linked` instruction performs a load from a specified memory address and sets an internal monitor or "link" on that cache line. Subsequently, a `Store Conditional` instruction attempts to perform a store to the same address. The `Store Conditional` succeeds only if the monitored memory location has not been modified by another processor between the `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` operations, and crucially, if the cache line containing the address has not been evicted from the processor's cache. If the `Store Conditional` succeeds, the store is performed atomically. If it fails, the store does not occur, and the operation typically returns an indication of failure, necessitating a retry.

From an architectural viewpoint, the `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` paradigm introduces complexity, particularly in deeply pipelined processors. The need to "tag" the associated cache line and for the processor to "notice" any subsequent eviction of that line means that `Store Conditional` success is contingent not only on logical contention, such as another processor modifying the data, but also on various spurious, hardware-related events. This is why a `fetch and Phi` operation, when implemented with `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional`, utilizes a `repeat until` loop to handle potential spurious failures of the `Store Conditional` instruction.

Let us analyze the pseudo-code for `fetch and Phi`. The function `fetch and Phi` takes a function `Phi` and an `atomic word` pointer `w` as arguments. It declares local variables `old` and `new` to hold data. The `repeat` block begins by reading the current value of `w` into `old` using the `Load Linked` operation. Next, the `new` value is computed by applying the function `Phi` to `old`. This represents the "modify" step of the read-modify-write sequence. The loop continues until `w` performs a `Store Conditional` operation with the value `new` and `Release ordering`, which succeeds. Finally, the function returns the `old` value, which was the value of `w` before the atomic update.

The success of the `Store Conditional` operation is not solely dependent on the absence of concurrent writes. It can fail due to several practical, machine-specific conditions. For instance, if another thread modifies the location pointed to by `w`, the `Store Conditional` is guaranteed to fail, reflecting a genuine data conflict. However, on many machines, `Store Conditional` can also fail spuriously. This includes scenarios where a hardware interrupt occurs within the critical window between `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional`, a cache conflict or miss causes the monitored cache line to be evicted, or the processor mispredicts a branch, leading to pipeline flushes that invalidate the `Load Linked`'s context. Furthermore, certain "unsafe" instructions executed between the `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` can cause the `Store Conditional` to fail, or necessitate a re-computation of `Phi`. This non-deterministic failure behavior is a key challenge when working with `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` directly and often requires careful consideration of the instruction sequence.

While `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` is a powerful primitive, `Compare And Swap` is often considered a more abstract and widely supported atomic operation. `Compare And Swap` checks if a memory location's current value is equal to an expected value; if so, it atomically updates it to a new value. `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` can indeed be used to emulate `Compare And Swap`. This emulation, however, typically involves a loop to handle the potential spurious failures of the `Store Conditional` instruction.

The `C plus plus eleven` standard introduced explicit atomic types and operations, including two variants of `Compare And Swap`: `atomic compare exchange strong` and `atomic compare exchange weak`. The distinction between these two lies in their failure guarantees. `atomic compare exchange strong` guarantees that it will only fail if the expected value was genuinely not found, meaning a concurrent modification occurred. It will not fail spuriously. On `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` based architectures, `atomic compare exchange strong` might be implemented with an internal `repeat until` loop to abstract away the spurious failures of the underlying `Store Conditional` instruction.

Conversely, `atomic compare exchange weak` admits the possibility of spurious failures, much like `Store Conditional`. It might return false even if the expected value was present and no actual data conflict occurred. This behavior, while potentially less intuitive for the programmer, can sometimes map more directly and efficiently to `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` hardware, as it avoids the overhead of preventing or masking spurious failures. For algorithms that inherently require a retry loop, such as the `fetch and Phi` implementation shown, using `atomic compare exchange weak` can lead to more terse and efficient assembly code, as the retry logic is already part of the algorithm's design and aligns with the hardware's characteristics. The choice between `strong` and `weak` versions hinges on the specific performance characteristics of the underlying hardware and the algorithmic design, balancing strict guarantees against potential execution efficiency.

The discussion concludes by emphasizing that synchronization primitives are used within larger programs, necessitating careful consideration of broader memory ordering constraints beyond those intrinsic to the primitive itself. It suggests that allowing explicit memory ordering annotations, such as `Read Write` memory ordering, for higher-level primitives like `fetch and Phi` could be beneficial for programmers. However, incorporating these constraints directly into atomic instructions within a retry loop could incur significant performance overhead on every iteration. An arguably superior strategy, when applicable, is to strategically place memory fences or barriers at the beginning and end of the entire atomic routine, rather than within the retry loop, to amortize the cost of these expensive operations and ensure correct global memory visibility without excessively penalizing common retry paths.

The A B A problem, a well-known pitfall in lock-free programming, primarily affects `Compare And Swap` based algorithms. This problem occurs when a memory location's value changes from `A` to `B` and then back to `A` during the interval between a thread's initial read of `A` and its subsequent `Compare And Swap` attempt. Since the value is `A` again when the `Compare And Swap` executes, the operation succeeds, even though the underlying state or the logical sequence of elements might have been altered in a way that renders the `Compare And Swap`'s success logically incorrect, leading to data corruption or silent failures. This is particularly worrisome in pointer-based data structures like linked lists, where pointers might be reused after a node is popped and subsequently pushed back onto the structure.

To mitigate the A B A problem, alternative atomic primitives such as `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional`, or techniques like adding version tags or counters to pointers, are often employed. `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` operations, unlike `Compare And Swap`, detect any intervening write to the monitored memory location between the `Load Linked` and `Store Conditional` instructions, not just a value change and subsequent return. Version tagging involves incrementing a small counter associated with a pointer or node every time the node is reused or the pointer changes its target. The `Compare And Swap` operation is then extended to compare both the pointer value and its associated tag, ensuring that if the pointer value returns, the tag value will be different, causing the `Compare And Swap` to correctly fail and signal a retry. These advanced techniques ensure the correctness and robustness of lock-free data structures in highly concurrent environments.
