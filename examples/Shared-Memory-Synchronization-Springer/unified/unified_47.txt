The provided content delves into the intricacies of nonblocking algorithms, specifically focusing on data structure operations in concurrent environments. At its core, it discusses strategies for searching and modifying linked lists in a manner that avoids traditional locking mechanisms, thereby preventing potential deadlocks and improving scalability.

Figure eight point six illustrates the concept of searching within a hand over hand locked list, often referred to as an H and M list. This data structure utilizes a marked counted pointer mechanism. A pointer, denoted as P R E V p, points to the previous node, while C U R R points to the current node being examined, and N E X T points to the subsequent node. The diagrams labeled a, b, c, and d depict the state of these pointers during a search operation, showing their positions relative to nodes containing values ten, twenty, and thirty. The return value of a search is considered true if the sought value is precisely located at the current pointer's target node, and it is predicated on the search value being less than or equal to ten, twenty, or thirty respectively, or greater than thirty. A crucial aspect of this search strategy is its ability to traverse nodes even when their next pointers are marked, which signifies that the node has been removed from the list. The robustness of this approach hinges on the argument that searches can proceed unhindered by such marks, implying that the traversal logic correctly interprets the state of the list despite concurrent modifications.

The text then elaborates on the challenge of ensuring correctness in concurrent linked list operations, particularly when dealing with node deletions. A strategy introduced by Timnat, Fomichev, and Ruppert in their two thousand fifteen work involves an elegant reuse of pointer fields. Instead of introducing a dedicated back pointer field into each node, this approach designates the next pointer of a logically deleted node to serve as its back pointer. This design allows an operation to efficiently locate the predecessor of a node simply by following the next pointers, thus avoiding the need to maintain separate back pointers. To guarantee the integrity of this strategy, an operation must atomically perform the deletion of a node and the modification of its predecessor's next pointer. This atomicity is achieved through a sophisticated synchronization primitive known as multi compare multiple swap, or M C M S, also referred to as k C A S. This primitive enables the simultaneous modification of multiple memory locations. The text notes that such M C M S operations can be implemented in software, or alternatively, can be accelerated through hardware transactional memory on contemporary processors, as discussed in Section nine point two.

Furthermore, Braginsky and Petrank, in their two thousand eleven publication, introduced a lock-free variation of a chunked linked list algorithm. Their key innovation lies in reducing pointer overhead by packing multiple values into each linked list node, thereby improving cache utilization and potentially performance.

A critical consideration highlighted in footnote one pertains to the implications of pointer modification timing relative to node deletion. If a back pointer is updated before the node it points to is removed from the list, and if that node is subsequently deleted, the back pointer might remain pointing to a deallocated memory location. This could lead to a cycle in the list if the calling thread stalls or crashes, leaving other threads attempting to traverse the list with a dangling pointer, unable to reach a valid back pointer. Conversely, if the back pointer update occurs after the node deletion, the next pointer of the preceding node might remain unchanged, potentially preserving access to the back pointer, but this scenario also presents complexities regarding the consistency of the list state.

The Michael and Scott queue, often referred to as the M and S queue, is a prominent example of a lock-free data structure designed for concurrent environments. Unlike lock-based queues that rely on mutual exclusion primitives to protect shared data, lock-free structures guarantee that at least one thread will make progress in a finite number of steps, even in the presence of multiple concurrent operations. This nonblocking property is typically achieved through the use of hardware-supported atomic operations, such as compare-and-swap, or C A S.

The M and S queue is implemented as a singly linked list with a dummy node at the head. This design choice simplifies the logic for handling empty and single-element queues, as operations always have at least one node to work with. The queue maintains two pointers: head and tail. The head pointer points to the dummy node, while the tail pointer points to the last actual element in the queue.

Enqueue operations involve adding a new node to the tail of the list. A thread attempting to enqueue first allocates a new node and sets its value. Then, it reads the current tail pointer and attempts to link the new node to the end of the list. This is typically done using a C A S operation on the next pointer of the node currently pointed to by tail. If the C A S succeeds, the thread then attempts to advance the tail pointer to the newly added node, again using a C A S operation. The key challenge here is managing concurrent updates to the tail pointer. If another thread successfully enqueues an element and advances the tail pointer before the current thread attempts to advance it, the current thread's C A S operation to advance the tail will fail, requiring a retry.

Dequeue operations, conversely, involve removing a node from the head of the list. A thread attempting to dequeue first reads the current head and tail pointers. It then reads the node pointed to by head's next pointer, which represents the first actual element in the queue. The value of this first element is then returned. The critical atomic step is to update the head pointer to this first element using a C A S operation. A special condition arises when the queue is empty or contains only a single element. In the M and S queue, a dummy node is always present. When a dequeue operation is attempted on a queue with a single element, which is the first node after the dummy node, the dequeue operation involves advancing the head pointer to bypass the first element, effectively making the dummy node the head again and the first element the new tail. If the tail pointer has also moved to the first element, it must also be updated to the dummy node.

Figure eight point seven illustrates the operation of the M and S queue. Specifically, it shows the atomic steps involved. For a dequeue operation, a thread first reads the head and then the node following the head. It then attempts to update the head pointer using a C A S operation to point to the next node in the list, effectively removing the old first node. For an enqueue operation, a thread creates a new node and attempts to link it to the end of the list by performing a C A S on the next pointer of the current tail node. Following a successful linking, it attempts to advance the tail pointer to the new node. The diagram shows two C A S operations for enqueue: C A S two updates the tail's next pointer, and C A S one potentially updates the tail pointer itself. Similarly, dequeue operations require careful management of the head pointer, often involving a C A S to update the head to the next node. The diagram highlights that after appropriate preparation, which involves "snapshotting" the head and tail pointers and validating them, a dequeue operation requires one C A S to remove the old dummy node. In the enqueue operation, one C A S is used to update the next pointer of the current tail, and another C A S is used to update the tail pointer itself to the newly added node.

The M and S queue is designed to be lock-free and avoids the possibility of livelock, although starvation is theoretically possible, meaning a thread might repeatedly fail to complete its operation. The implementation ensures that if a single enqueue and a single dequeue are active concurrently, one of them is guaranteed to complete in a bounded number of steps. If multiple enqueues or dequeues are active, their completion times can vary, but the system as a whole continues to make progress.

A crucial aspect of understanding the correctness of concurrent data structures like the M and S queue is the concept of linearization. Linearization is a property that ensures that concurrent operations on a data structure behave as if they were executed atomically and sequentially in some serial order. For the M and S queue, each operation is assigned a linearization point, which is a specific point in its execution that corresponds to its abstract sequential behavior. For example, a successful enqueue operation is often linearized at the point where the new node's next pointer is successfully updated. A successful dequeue operation is linearized at the point where the head pointer is successfully updated to point to the next node.

To understand the behavior of the queue, it is helpful to consider linearization points. For instance, when a thread attempts to enqueue an item and another thread attempts to dequeue, the order in which their respective C A S operations complete determines the linearized order of the operations. A successful dequeue that moves the head pointer effectively removes the first element. An unsuccessful dequeue, one that fails to update the head pointer perhaps because another dequeue or an enqueue modified the list concurrently, returns a special value, often denoted as bottom or null, indicating that the operation did not complete as intended. This failure might require the thread to retry the operation. The M and S queue's design, particularly the use of the dummy node and the careful sequencing of C A S operations, ensures that these operations can be effectively linearized, providing a correct and efficient concurrent queue implementation.

The provided code defines a node structure, which is the fundamental building block of the queue. Each node contains an atomic value field, representing the data stored in that node, and an atomic next pointer field. The use of atomic next pointer indicates that operations on this pointer, such as loading its value or attempting to swap it, are atomic, meaning they are indivisible and uninterruptible.

A queue class encapsulates the queue's state, holding atomic pointers to the head and tail of the linked list that forms the queue. The init function initializes the queue by creating a sentinel node. This sentinel node acts as a placeholder and simplifies boundary conditions. Both head and tail are initially set to point to this sentinel node, which itself points to null.

The enqueue operation involves adding a new node to the tail of the queue. It begins by allocating a new node with the provided value and a null next pointer. Then, it enters a loop, which is characteristic of lock-free algorithms. Inside the loop, it first reads the current tail of the queue and then reads the next pointer of the node currently pointed to by the tail. The algorithm checks for consistency: if the tail pointer itself hasn't changed since it was last read, and if the next pointer of the node indicated by tail is null, it proceeds to attempt to link the new node. This linking is done using a C A S operation on the next pointer of the current tail node. The C A S operation attempts to atomically update the next pointer to point to the new node, but only if the next pointer still holds its previously read value. If this C A S succeeds, the new node has been successfully appended. The algorithm then attempts to advance the tail pointer to the newly added node using another C A S operation. If the C A S to update the tail fails, it means another thread has already modified the tail, so the current thread retries the entire enqueue operation from the beginning of the loop.

A crucial aspect mentioned in the comments is the use of counted pointers. These are not explicitly defined in the code snippet but are a common technique in lock-free programming to manage memory safely. In a lock-free data structure, simply removing a node from the queue does not immediately make it safe to deallocate, as other threads might still be holding pointers to it. Counted pointers typically involve storing both the pointer to the object and a counter indicating how many active references exist. Deallocation occurs only when the counter reaches zero. The M and S algorithm, particularly when dealing with potential ABA problem scenarios, leverages these counted pointers to ensure that nodes are not prematurely freed while other threads are still operating on them. The ABA problem arises when a value is read, then modified, then restored to its original value, leading a C A S operation to succeed incorrectly, believing no change occurred. Counted pointers, by changing the pointer value itself, even if the memory address is reused, help mitigate this.

The dequeue operation is more complex. It starts by reading the head and tail pointers. It then reads the next pointer of the node currently pointed to by head. The first check is for consistency: ensuring that the head pointer has not been modified by another thread. If the head is consistent, and if the head's next pointer is null, it indicates that the queue is empty, and the operation signals this by returning a null value. If the queue is not empty, the algorithm attempts to dequeue the first actual element, which is the node following the sentinel head. It reads the value from this node and then attempts to advance the head pointer to this next node using a C A S operation. If this C A S succeeds, the element has been successfully dequeued, and the original sentinel node is then made available for reuse. If the C A S to advance the head fails, it implies another thread has already modified the head, so the current thread retries the dequeue operation. The comments highlight scenarios like the tail potentially falling behind or the queue becoming empty, which are handled by retrying operations until a consistent state is achieved or the operation can be completed. The phrase otherwise another dequeue might free n suggests the careful handling of memory related to the node n being dequeued, reinforcing the importance of counted pointers or similar memory reclamation schemes. The code snippet demonstrates the intricate dance of atomic operations and retries required to implement a correct and efficient lock-free queue.
