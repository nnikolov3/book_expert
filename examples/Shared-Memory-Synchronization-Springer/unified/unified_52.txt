In the context of concurrent data structures, specifically the Extensible and Resilient Binary Search Tree, or EFRB tree, a node is considered locked when its update field points to a descriptor. This descriptor contains information about the operation that is currently holding the lock, allowing other threads to assist in completing the operation instead of waiting for the node to be unlocked. The EFRB tree enables a thread to help another operation only if its own operation is blocked by that operation, facilitating cooperation among threads.

A key concept in ensuring the consistency of these helping operations is idempotency, which means that performing an operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once. This is crucial in concurrent helping schemes, as a helper thread might execute a compare-and-swap, or CAS, operation multiple times if the lock is contended. The use of CAS operations, which are atomic instructions that perform a read-modify-write operation, ensures that each CAS step can succeed only once, making helping idempotent.

The EFRB tree node conceptually stores two separate fields within a single word: the state field, which can hold one of four possible values - Clean, IFlag, DFlag, or Mark - and the info field, which points to a descriptor. The Clean state indicates that the node is unlocked, while the IFlag and DFlag states indicate that the node is locked for an insert or delete operation, respectively. A node with a Mark state is considered locked indefinitely by the operation that deleted it.

When a node is locked by an operation, the info field points to the descriptor for that operation. Otherwise, it points to the descriptor for the last operation that locked the node. A node's child pointers can be changed by an operation only while the node is locked for that operation, and a locked node can be changed only in accordance with the operation that locked it. Notably, a node's key is immutable once set, meaning it cannot be changed without first unlocking the node.

The lookup operation in the EFRB tree is particularly noteworthy, as it does not require any synchronization between threads. It behaves exactly as it would in a sequential external binary search tree, performing a binary search on the tree starting at the root and continuing until it reaches a leaf, oblivious to the actions of other concurrent threads. If the leaf contains the key being searched for, the operation returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The idea of lock-free mutual exclusion, introduced by Barnes, underlies the EFRB tree's design. This concept involves using compare-and-swap operations instead of traditional locking mechanisms to manage concurrent access to shared data. The EFRB tree's use of distinct descriptor types and flagging techniques further refines this approach, enabling efficient and scalable concurrent operations.

In terms of implementation, the EFRB tree's data structure includes atomic pointers for the left and right child nodes, as well as an update pointer that facilitates the coordination of concurrent modifications. The tree's operations, including lookup, insert, and delete, are designed to work in a lock-free manner, leveraging CAS operations to ensure atomicity and consistency.

The search function, for example, traverses the tree based on key comparisons, returning a tuple containing the grandparent, parent, and parent's update pointer. This information is essential for subsequent atomic operations that may modify the tree structure. Helper functions, such as help_insert and help_delete, assist in completing ongoing operations, ensuring that the tree remains in a consistent state even in the presence of concurrent modifications.

The use of CAS operations and idempotent helping ensures that the EFRB tree can maintain its integrity and correctness, even under high concurrency. This is achieved through the careful design of the tree's data structure and operations, which prioritize atomicity, consistency, and cooperation among threads. As a result, the EFRB tree offers a highly efficient and scalable solution for concurrent search and update operations, making it an attractive choice for applications that require high performance and reliability in multi-threaded environments.
