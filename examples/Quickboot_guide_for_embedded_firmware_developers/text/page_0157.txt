limited to:
—Int 13h for disk including RAID option ROMs
—Int 16h for PS/2 keyboard
—Int 10h for video output from video BIOS

—BIOS’s SMI handler providing legacy USB keyboard support via port
60/64 emulation.

Depending on the desired features enabled by the boot loader, the OS needs
different tables. The following is a list of those tables:

—Memory Map (INT15h / Function E820h)
—Programmable Interrupt Routing ($PIR)
—Multi-Processor Specification (_MP_)

—Minimal Boot Loader for Intel® Architecture
—Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)

ACPI tables are needed only if those features are enabled by the boot loader
and required by the OS. Most modern operating systems, including RTOS,
are ACPI aware.

The _MP_ table is needed if there is more than one Intel processing
agent (more than one thread or core) in the system. Details on the _MP__ table
may be found in the Multi-Processor Specification.

The $PIR table and interrupt-based memory map are almost always
needed. Details on the $PIR table may be found in the $PIR Specification.
limited to: Int thirteen h for disk including R A I D option R O M s, Int sixteen h for P S slash two keyboard, Int ten h for video output from video B I O S, B I O S 's S M I handler providing legacy U S B keyboard support via port sixty four emulation.

Depending on the desired features enabled by the boot loader, the O S needs different tables. The following is a list of those tables: Memory Map ( I N T fifteen h / Function E eight twenty h ), Programmable Interrupt Routing ( $ P I R ), Multi Processor Specification ( _ M P_ ), Minimal Boot Loader for Intel R Architecture, Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( A C P I ).

A C P I tables are needed only if those features are enabled by the boot loader and required by the O S. Most modern operating systems, including R T O S, are A C P I aware.

The _ M P_ table is needed if there is more than one Intel processing agent (more than one thread or core) in the system. Details on the _ M P_ table may be found in the Multi Processor Specification. The $ P I R table and interrupt based memory map are almost always needed. Details on the $ P I R table may be found in the $ P I R Specification.
The text discusses hardware abstraction and system configuration, focusing on the roles of the Basic Input/Output System, or B I O S, and specific configuration tables that an operating system, or O S, might utilize.

It begins by enumerating certain B I O S functions, specifically interrupt calls. "Interrupt thirteen H" is noted for disk operations, which would include handling data read or write requests, potentially in conjunction with Redundant Array of Independent Disks, or R A I D, option Read Only Memory, or R O M s. These R O M s store firmware for storage controllers, enabling direct hardware interaction for disk management before the main O S drivers are loaded. "Interrupt sixteen H" is specified for the P S/two keyboard interface, a legacy standard for input devices that involves polling or interrupt-driven communication to receive keystroke data. "Interrupt ten H" is associated with video output from the video B I O S, which handles the initial display initialization and rendering before the graphics drivers within the O S take over.

Further, the B I O S is described as having an S M I, or System Management Interrupt, handler that provides support for legacy U S B keyboard functionality through a port emulation scheme, specifically mentioning sixty forty emulation. S M I s are a critical mechanism for power management and other system-level tasks, often invoked by dedicated hardware. The legacy U S B support indicates a need to bridge newer hardware interfaces with older software expectations, common during transitional periods in computing architecture.

The operational flow then shifts to how the O S depends on configuration information determined by the boot loader. The boot loader's role is to initialize the hardware and load the operating system kernel. If certain features are enabled, the O S requires access to different configuration tables. The text lists these tables:

The "Memory Map" table, potentially associated with "Interrupt fifteen H" and "Function E eight twenty H," would define the layout of the system's memory, including address ranges for various devices, main memory, and potentially memory-mapped input/output, or M M I O, regions.

The "Programmable Interrupt Routing," or $ P I R, table, details how hardware interrupts are routed to specific processors or interrupt controllers within the system. This is crucial for efficient interrupt handling, especially in multi-processor or multi-core environments, ensuring that interrupt requests are serviced by the appropriate processing unit.

The "Multi Processor Specification," or $ M P _, table, provides information necessary for initializing and managing multiple processors or processor cores. This includes details on the number of processors, their architecture, cache coherency protocols, and inter-processor communication mechanisms, essential for symmetric multi-processing, or S M P, systems.

The "Minimal Boot Loader" for the Intel architecture specifies a baseline configuration required for the boot process on Intel processors. This often includes essential hardware detection and initialization routines.

Finally, the "Advanced Configuration and Power Interface," or A C P I, tables are mentioned. A C P I is a standardized interface that allows the operating system to manage hardware power states, thermal management, and configuration settings. It replaces older, proprietary methods like the Plug and Play, or P n P, standards.

The text clarifies that A C P I tables are particularly important if the system features are enabled by the boot loader and are required by the O S. Modern operating systems, including real-time operating systems, or R T O S, generally expect A C P I compliance.

The $ M P _ table is needed when there is more than one Intel processing agent, which could refer to multiple physical CPUs or multiple cores within a single CPU package. Details regarding this table can be found in the Multi Processor Specification documentation. Similarly, the $ P I R table, which describes interrupt-based memory mapping, is almost always needed. Further information on the $ P I R table is available in the $ P I R Specification. This highlights a layered approach to system configuration, where a boot loader provides foundational information, and more detailed, standardized tables like A C P I offer richer control and management capabilities for the operating system.
