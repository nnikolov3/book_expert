Table one presents key timing parameters for memory modules, categorized by speed grade. The speed grades, such as minus one two five superscript one superscript two, minus one two five E superscript one superscript two, minus one five three, minus one five E one, minus one eight seven, and minus one eight seven E, denote different performance tiers. Corresponding to these speed grades are data rates measured in mega transfers per second, with values ranging from one thousand sixty six to one thousand six hundred.

The table also details target timing parameters essential for synchronous memory operation. These include t R C D, which is the Row Column Delay, and t R P, the Row Precharge time, both crucial for accessing data within memory arrays. Furthermore, t C L, or CAS Latency, specifies the number of clock cycles between the column address strobe being asserted and the data being available. The table provides target values for these timings, illustrating how they scale with the data rate. For instance, at a data rate of one thousand six hundred mega transfers per second, the target t R C D, t R P, and t C L are eleven dash eleven dash eleven. As the data rate decreases, these timings generally increase. For a speed grade of minus one eight seven, with a data rate of one thousand sixty six mega transfers per second, the target timings are seven dash seven dash seven, and the CAS Latency is seven nanoseconds.

The notes section elaborates on backward compatibility aspects. Note one indicates that a configuration compatible with one thousand sixty six mega transfers per second and a CAS Latency of seven nanoseconds is backward compatible to the minus one eight seven E speed grade. Similarly, note two states that a configuration compatible with one thousand three hundred thirty three mega transfers per second and a CAS Latency of nine nanoseconds is backward compatible to the minus one five E speed grade. Note three highlights backward compatibility to one thousand sixty six mega transfers per second with a CAS Latency of eight nanoseconds for the minus one eight seven speed grade. These notes are vital for system integrators ensuring interoperability between memory modules of varying specifications.

The document then references SPD Field number sixteen, which pertains to the "Minimum CAS Latency Time" as specified in a Micron MT four one J two five six M eight datasheet. This implies that a specific bit field within the Serial Presence Detect (S P D) ROM of the memory module stores this critical timing parameter, which is a measure of the minimum latency required for a read operation after the column address has been received.

Subsequently, SPD Field zero hexadecimal eleven is mentioned, relating to "Write Recovery Time" or t W R. This parameter defines the minimum time required between the completion of a write command and the next command being issued to the memory device. The explanation clarifies that this value is also extracted from the datasheet and is further processed, specifically divided by the "Medium Timebase Divisor." This indicates a potential transformation or scaling of the raw value found in the S P D field to derive the actual write recovery time, likely to accommodate different clock frequencies or system configurations. The Medium Timebase Divisor itself is a value derived from other S P D fields, typically used to convert the timing parameters stored in S P D into actual time units.
