Depending on the BIOS settings and configuration algorithm
optimization, there could be several access attempts to Oxfed40000
to detect whether TPM existed on the platform, and each access
could cost about 7 ms. Adding an HOB, a UEFI hand off block, to
save the data after the very first access to the Oxfed40000 could be
used to indicate whether TPM is present on the board or not. The
rest of the components should then reference to this HOB instead of
checking for the presence of the TPM on system. Read the same

information across IO just one time...

Copying data into memory before hashing will save time over hashing

in-place.

Operating System Interactions

The following section describes operating system interactions.

Compatibility Segment Module and Legacy Option ROMs

In a UEFI BIOS, a Class 3 UEFI solution will normally be more than 100 ms
faster than a legacy OS-supported solution; that is, the CSM time to execute
(without additional delay due to legacy option ROMs). Again, this is a
tradeoff between OS compatibility support with older operating systems and

boot speeds. Setup menu options can disable the CSM if it is not required.
Depending on the B I O S settings and configuration algorithm optimization, there could be several access attempts to hexadecimal F fed four zero zero zero zero to detect whether T P M existed on the platform, and each access could cost about seven milliseconds. Adding an H O B, a U E F I hand off block, to save the data after the very first access to the hexadecimal F fed four zero zero zero zero could be used to indicate whether T P M is present on the board or not. The rest of the components should then reference to this H O B instead of checking for the presence of the T P M on system. Read the same information across I O just one time.

Seven. Copying data into memory before hashing will save time over hashing in place.

Operating System Interactions

The following section describes operating system interactions.

Compatibility Segment Module and Legacy Option R O M s

In a U E F I B I O S, a Class three U E F I solution will normally be more than one hundred milliseconds faster than a legacy O S supported solution; that is, the C S M time to execute without additional delay due to legacy option R O M s. Again, this is a trade off between O S compatibility support with older operating systems and boot speeds. Setup menu options can disable the C S M if it is not required.
The provided text delves into aspects of system initialization and operating system interactions, specifically concerning the Trusted Platform Module, or T P M, and legacy hardware support within the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I.

The initial paragraph discusses optimization strategies within the Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, settings and configuration algorithms. It highlights potential performance impacts, mentioning access attempts to a specific memory address, hexadecimal F E D four thousand, and the associated time cost, approximately seven milliseconds. The concept of a Hand Off Block, or H O B, is introduced as a mechanism for transferring control or information. The text suggests that after the initial access to hexadecimal F E D four thousand, subsequent components should reference this H O B to determine the presence of the T P M on the system. This implies an efficient approach to resource discovery, aiming to read the relevant information only once for the entire system, thereby minimizing input output, or I O, operations and optimizing overall boot time.

The subsequent point, numbered seven, introduces the concept of copying data into memory before hashing. This suggests a data processing pipeline where hashing operations, a fundamental cryptographic or data integrity technique, are applied to data that has already been staged in volatile memory, potentially for improved performance compared to hashing directly from a slower storage medium.

The text then transitions to "Operating System Interactions," indicating a shift in focus to how the operating system engages with system hardware and firmware. It states that the following section will elaborate on these interactions.

The final section addresses "Compatibility Segment Module and Legacy Option ROMs." This points to a critical area in system architecture: the interplay between modern firmware standards, like U E F I, and older technologies, specifically legacy Option Read Only Memory, or R O M s. It states that a U E F I BIOS, specifically a Class three U E F I solution, is generally faster, exceeding one hundred milliseconds, compared to a legacy O S supported solution. The delay in legacy solutions is attributed to the time required to execute legacy Option R O M s. This represents a trade off: while U E F I offers efficiency, it might require compatibility support for older operating systems and boot processes. The Compatibility Segment Module, or C S M, is identified as a key component that facilitates this backward compatibility. The text concludes by noting that setup menu options can be used to disable the C S M if it is not necessary, further optimizing boot times by avoiding the overhead associated with legacy hardware emulation or support. This highlights a design choice in modern systems: providing a path for legacy compatibility while allowing users to bypass it for maximum performance.
