Figure A.1: Chip Select Pins for a Single Memory Channel

Memory-down designs don’t use DIMMs; the SDRAM chips are soldered
directly onto the motherboard. The chip select signals will be routed to the
SDRAM chips in the same manner, however. In Figure A.2 below, on
channel 0, only CS#[0] is connected to all eight SDRAM chips. Channel 0 is
supporting only one single-rank DIMM equivalent. Channel 1 is also

supporting a single- rank DIMM equivalent.

The diagram shows a DRAM controller connected to SDRAM chips. The controller outputs address signals, denoted as A[15:0], and data signals, DQ[71:0], along with RAS# and CAS# control signals. The diagram illustrates how chip select signals CS#0 through CS#5 are routed to different SDRAM chips. Specifically, CS#0 is connected to the first SDRAM chip, CS#1 to the second, and so on. The diagram also shows two memory modules labeled 2 gigabyte and 1 gigabyte, suggesting the capacity of the installed memory. The connections indicate that different chip select signals enable individual or groups of SDRAM chips.

Memory-down designs don't use D I M M s; the S D R A M chips are soldered directly onto the motherboard. The chip select signals will be routed to the S D R A M chips in the same manner, however.

The provided figure illustrates the chip select pins for a single memory channel within a system architecture, focusing on a "memory down" design where the Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or S D Ram, chips are directly soldered onto the motherboard rather than being installed via Dual In line Memory Modules, or D I M M s. This configuration dictates how the chip select signals, crucial for enabling communication with specific memory components, are routed.

The diagram depicts a D R A M controller, typically integrated within the north bridge of a motherboard's chipset, communicating with multiple S D Ram chips. The controller outputs various signals, including address lines A[15:0], data lines D Q[71:0], and command and control signals such as R A S sharp and C A S sharp. In this memory down implementation, these signals are broadcast to a bank of S D Ram chips. The key differentiation for accessing individual chips or groups of chips lies in the chip select, or C S sharp, signals.

Specifically, the diagram shows that for channel zero, the C S sharp[zero] signal is connected to all eight S D Ram chips on that channel. This signifies a configuration where the entire set of eight chips acts as a single logical unit, or a single rank, in memory access operations. In contrast, channel one is also supporting a single rank D I M M equivalent, implying a similar one to many mapping for its C S sharp signal to its associated S D Ram chips. This method of signal distribution allows the D R A M controller to select an entire group of chips simultaneously for an operation, simplifying the control logic compared to systems requiring individual chip selection for each S D Ram device. The differing capacities indicated, two gigabytes and one gigabyte, likely represent the total capacity of the memory modules or ranks being illustrated.

The text also touches upon E C C, or Error Correcting Code, calculation. It states that data signals on the schematics need to be analyzed to determine if the down on board memory implements E C C. The presence of E C C data signals, such as D D R C B[7:0] often referred to as "check bits," is a strong indicator of E C C functionality. The number of these check bits and how they are generated and utilized are dependent on the specific chipset and the E C C algorithm employed, suggesting variability in implementation across different system configurations. E C C is a crucial technique in computer memory to detect and correct errors that can occur due to various physical phenomena, ensuring data integrity, particularly in critical applications or high-reliability systems. The detection and correction of errors typically involve parity checks and more complex algorithms like Hamming codes or Reed Solomon codes, which generate redundant bits that can be used to identify and often fix corrupted data bits.
