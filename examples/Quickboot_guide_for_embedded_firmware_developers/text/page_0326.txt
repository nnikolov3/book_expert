The provided text discusses a timing calculation scenario in the context of DDR memory. It explains that a sequential operation necessitates the selection of the next higher supported WR value. An example is given for DDR3-1333G operating at DDR3-1333 speeds, where the actual clock cycle time, tCKactual, is one point five nanoseconds. This leads to a calculation of WRdesired, which is derived by dividing fifteen by one point five, resulting in ten. Subsequently, WRactual is determined by taking the maximum of ten and ten, yielding ten.

The subsequent table, titled "Table Fifty-six Electrical Characteristics and AC Operating Conditions (Continued)", presents a detailed breakdown of timing parameters for various DDR3 memory speeds, specifically DDR3-800, DDR3-1066, DDR3-1333, and DDR3-1600. The table includes parameters such as DQS, DQS# differential READ postamble, identified by the symbol 'RPST', with minimum and maximum values specified in nanoseconds, or as notes indicating other dependencies. For instance, the minimum value for 'RPST' is zero point three nanoseconds, and the maximum is noted as twenty-seven, implying a dependency on other factors or speed bins for this parameter.

Under the "Command and Address Timings" section, several critical timing parameters are enumerated. The DLL locking time is shown to be five hundred twelve clock cycles across all specified DDR3 speeds. Following this, we see timing specifications for the setup and hold times of control, command, and address signals relative to the clock and its complement. For example, the 'IS' parameter, representing the setup time for address and command signals to the clock, exhibits variations across the different DDR3 standards. For DDR3-1066, the minimum 'IS' is one hundred twenty-five picoseconds, while for DDR3-1333, it is sixty-five picoseconds. Similarly, the 'IH' parameter, representing the hold time, also varies. The minimum 'IH' for DDR3-1066 is two hundred picoseconds, and for DDR3-1333, it is one hundred forty picoseconds.

The table also details the minimum pulse width for control, command, and address signals, denoted by 'IPW', and the delay from an ACTIVATE command to an internal READ or WRITE command, referred to as 'RCD'. The 'IPW' parameter shows minimum values ranging from nine hundred picoseconds for DDR3-800 down to six hundred twenty picoseconds for DDR3-1333. For the 'RCD' parameter, the table indicates that users should refer to Speed Bin Tables, with a unit of nanoseconds. These parameters are fundamental to ensuring reliable data transfer and signal integrity in high-speed memory systems, reflecting the complex interplay between clocking, data strobes, command signals, and memory controller operations. The variations in these timings across different memory speeds highlight the design trade-offs and engineering challenges involved in achieving higher data rates.
