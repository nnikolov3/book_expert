The document presents timing specifications for DDR3 memory, a prevalent synchronous dynamic random access memory technology. The initial section outlines the relationship between "tRR D" in Minimum Time Base (MTB) units and its equivalent result in nanoseconds, along with a corresponding "Use" case. Specifically, it shows that for a tRR D value of forty eight MTB units, the timebase is zero point one two five nanoseconds, yielding a tRR D result of six point zero nanoseconds, often associated with DDR three hyphen one three three three with a one K B page size. Similarly, sixty MTB units translate to seven point five nanoseconds for DDR three hyphen one three three three with a two K B page size, and eighty MTB units result in ten nanoseconds for DDR three hyphen eight hundred with a one K B page size. A critical note clarifies that tRR D is independent of operating frequency, indicating that the minimum number of clock cycles required for this timing parameter remains constant regardless of the clock speed.

Table fifty six details "Electrical Characteristics and AC Operating Conditions (Continued)," with notes one through eight applying to the entire table. This table focuses on command and address timings. A key parameter presented is "D Q S, D Q S # differential R E A D postamble." This refers to the setup and hold times for the data strobe signal and its inverted counterpart relative to the data transfer during a read operation. The symbol for this timing parameter is 'R P S T'. For DDR three hyphen eight hundred memory, the minimum R P S T is zero point three nanoseconds, with a maximum not specified, indicated by "Note twenty seven." For DDR three hyphen one zero six six memory, the minimum R P S T is also zero point three nanoseconds, again with "Note twenty seven" for the maximum. DDR three hyphen one three three three exhibits the same zero point three nanosecond minimum, with "Note twenty seven" for the maximum. Finally, DDR three hyphen one six hundred shows a zero point three nanosecond minimum and "Note twenty seven" for the maximum. The unit for this parameter is clock cycles, denoted as C K.

Another significant timing parameter detailed is "D L L locking time." The Delay Locked Loop, or D L L, is a circuit used in synchronous memory interfaces to ensure precise timing alignment between the memory controller and the memory devices. The table specifies the D L L locking time in nanoseconds. For DDR three hyphen eight hundred, the D L L locking time is five hundred twelve nanoseconds. Similarly, for DDR three hyphen one zero six six, it is five hundred twelve nanoseconds. DDR three hyphen one three three three also requires five hundred twelve nanoseconds, and DDR three hyphen one six hundred likewise specifies five hundred twelve nanoseconds. The unit for this parameter is nanoseconds. The hyphens and "C K" in the table indicate that these values are often specified relative to the memory clock cycles, but in this context, they are given in absolute time units. The consistent values across different DDR three speeds for D L L locking time suggest that it is primarily dependent on the internal architecture of the memory module's phase-locked loop rather than the external memory clock frequency itself.
