SPD Field #26: “Minimum Internal Write to Read Command Delay Time
(twrmin)” Example from Micron MT41J256M8 Datasheet
SPD Field 0x1B: Min. Read to Precharge Command Delay (tgpmin)

This is another field that must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by

the Medium Timebase Divisor.

In our example:

1.
The tgp value found in the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet for our
specific SDRAM chip gives 7.5 ns.

2.
This number must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, the
value in 0x0B. In our example this is 0.125 ns.

3.
75ns/0.125 ns = 60 = 0x3C.

S P D Field Number twenty six: "Minimum Internal Write to Read Command Delay Time (t W T R min)" Example from Micron M T forty one J two hundred fifty six M eight Datasheet

S P D Field zero O times one B: Min. Read to Precharge Command Delay (t R T P min)

This is another field that must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor.

In our example:
one. The t R T P value found in the Micron M T forty one J two hundred fifty six M eight datasheet for our specific S D Ram chip gives seven point five ns.
two. This number must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, the value in zero O times B. In our example this is zero point one two five ns.
three. Seventy five ns divided by zero point one two five ns is sixty which is zero O times three C.

The table shows the following data: Byte (Decimal) is twenty seven, Byte (Hex) is zero O times one B, Field Name is Min. Read to Precharge Command Delay (t R T P min), Typ. Value is zero O times three C, and Definition is seven point five ns.
The provided text details specific timing parameters within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard, a crucial mechanism for the system firmware to discover and configure dynamic random access memory, or D Ram, modules. The first parameter discussed is S P D Field Number twenty six, which defines the "Minimum Internal Write to Read Command Delay Time," denoted as t W T R minimum. This parameter is critical for ensuring proper data integrity during read and write operations in a D Ram interface, specifying the minimum number of clock cycles required between a write command and a subsequent read command. The accompanying table clarifies that this parameter, found at byte offset hexadecimal one B, has a typical value of seventy five nanoseconds.

The text then elaborates on another S P D field, Field Zero x one B, which defines the "Min. Read to Precharge Command Delay," symbolized as t R T P minimum. This parameter dictates the minimum time interval between a read command and the subsequent precharge command. The explanation highlights that this value is derived from datasheets, such as the Micron MT41J256M8, and is then divided by a "Medium Timebase Divisor" to obtain the actual timing value used by the system. The example illustrates this process: a t R T P value of seven point five nanoseconds found in the Micron datasheet is divided by a Medium Timebase Divisor of zero point one two five nanoseconds. This division yields a result of sixty, which is represented in hexadecimal as zero x three C. This calculation is fundamental to translating raw timing specifications from component datasheets into system-usable timing constraints, accounting for differences in clock frequencies and internal timing methodologies. The S P D structure itself is a form of non volatile memory on a D Ram module, typically containing information about the module's capacity, speed, voltage, and other configuration parameters, making it essential for system initialization and optimal performance. The specific fields and their values, like t W T R minimum and t R T P minimum, are part of a larger set of timing parameters that define the complex operational envelope of modern D Ram devices, enabling the motherboard's memory controller to interact with the D Ram modules reliably at high speeds.
