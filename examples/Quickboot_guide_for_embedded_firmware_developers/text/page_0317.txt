SPD Field 0x0E and 0x0F: CAS Latencies Supported

The supported CAS latencies can be found in the SDRAM datasheet as
shown above. Each supported CAS latency must have its bit set in fields 14
and 15.

Byte (Dec) Byte (Hex) Field Name Typ. Value Definition

14 0x0E CAS Latencies Supported (CL&-CL11) Ox1E LL=5 6,78
15 0x0F CAS Latencies Supported (CL12-CL18) 0=00 Cl=5,6,7.8

From the JEDEC Specification:

Byte 14: CAS Latencies Supported, Least Significant Byte

Byte 15: CAS Latencies Supported, Most Significant Byte

These bytes define which CAS Latency (CL) values are supported. The range
is from CL = 4 through CL = 18 with one bit per possible CAS Latency. A 1
in a bit position means that CL is supported, a 0 in that bit position means it
is not supported. Since CL = 6 is required for all DDR3 speed bins, bit 2 of
SPD byte 14 is always 1. These values come from the DDR3 SDRAM
datasheet.

S P D Field number twelve: Cycle Time t c K min Example from Micron M T four one J two five six M eight Datasheet.

S P D Field zero x zero E and zero x zero F: C A S Latencies Supported.

The supported C A S latencies can be found in the S D R A M datasheet as shown above. Each supported C A S latency must have its bit set in fields fourteen and fifteen.

The table shows the byte values, field names, typical values, and definitions for supported C A S latencies. For byte fourteen, represented as zero x zero E in hexadecimal, the field name is C A S Latencies Supported C L four to C L eleven. The typical value is zero x one E, and the definition is C L equals five, six, seven, or eight. For byte fifteen, represented as zero x zero F in hexadecimal, the field name is C A S Latencies Supported C L twelve to C L eighteen. The typical value is zero x zero zero, and the definition is C L equals five, six, seven, or eight.

From the J E D E C Specification: Byte fourteen: C A S Latencies Supported, Least Significant Byte. Byte fifteen: C A S Latencies Supported, Most Significant Byte. These bytes define which C A S Latency C L values are supported. The range is from C L is equal to four through C L is equal to eighteen with one bit per possible C A S Latency. A one in a bit position means that C L is supported, a zero in that bit position means it is not supported. Since C L is equal to six is required for all D D R three speed bins, bit two of S P D byte fourteen is always one. These values come from the D D R three S D R A M datasheet.
This page details specific fields within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard, which is crucial for system firmware to identify and configure installed memory modules. Specifically, it focuses on S P D Field number twelve, related to cycle time, and S P D fields zero E and zero F, which define supported C A S Latencies for S D Ram.

S P D Field twelve, as exemplified by Micron's M T four one J two fifty six M eight data sheet, pertains to the minimum clock cycle time, often denoted as t C K min. This parameter is fundamental to determining the maximum operating frequency of the memory module, as it represents the shortest valid clock pulse width.

The subsequent sections delve into the representation of C A S Latency, or C L, values. C L is a critical timing parameter in synchronous dynamic random access memory, S D Ram, indicating the number of clock cycles between the memory controller issuing a read command and the data becoming available on the output pins. The S P D fields zero E and zero F are utilized for this purpose. Field zero E, corresponding to Byte fourteen, is designated as the Least Significant Byte for C A S Latencies Supported, covering C L values from four through eleven. Field zero F, Byte fifteen, serves as the Most Significant Byte and extends this support for C L values from twelve through eighteen.

The table provided illustrates the direct mapping between these S P D bytes and the supported C L values. For Byte fourteen, the hexadecimal value zero E hex is associated with a typical value of one E hex, which translates to supporting C L values of five, six, seven, and eight. For Byte fifteen, the hexadecimal value zero F hex is associated with a typical value of zero zero hex, indicating support for C L values of five, six, seven, and eight as well.

The J E D E C specification elaborates on this bit field encoding. Within the context of these bytes, each bit position corresponds to a specific C L value, starting from C L equals four up to C L equals eighteen. A '1' in a bit position signifies that the corresponding C L value is supported by the memory module, while a '0' indicates it is not. For instance, if C L equals six is a requirement for all D D R three speed bins, it implies that the bit corresponding to C L six must be set to '1' in the relevant S P D field. The document further notes that for D D R three speed bins, bit two of S P D byte fourteen is consistently set to '1', which aligns with the supported C L values described. This mechanism allows the system's memory controller to dynamically ascertain the capabilities of the installed memory and configure it optimally for performance and stability.
