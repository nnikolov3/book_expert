S P D Field number twenty one: "Upper Nibbles for t R A S and t R C" Definition from J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification
This page delves into the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard, specifically focusing on fields related to DRAM timing parameters. It highlights the requirement that certain timing parameters, denoted by the Greek letter tau, such as CAS Latency, or C L, and C W L, Column Write Latency, must be met. A note indicates that reserved settings are not permitted.

The discussion then moves to S P D Field number twenty, which is designated for the "Minimum Row Precharge Delay Time," represented as t RP min. This field is derived from a Micron MT41J256M8 Datasheet.

A significant portion of the page is dedicated to S P D Field zero through fifteen, which defines the "Upper Nibble of t RAS and t RC." This field, comprising four bits, serves as the most significant nibble for both the Active to Precharge Delay, t RAS min, and the Active to Active/Refresh Delay, t RC min. The document directs the reader to subsequent sections for determining the precise values of t RAS min and t RC min, and then instructs to place the upper nibble of these results into this specific S P D field.

A table is presented that maps a decimal byte index to its hexadecimal representation, a field name, a typical value, and a definition. Byte index twenty one, represented in hexadecimal as zero x fifteen, is associated with the field name "Upper Nibble of t RAS & t RC." The typical value for this field is shown as zero x eleven, with the definition indicating a placeholder for the actual definition.

Following the table, a clarification is provided for Byte twenty one, which specifically pertains to the "Upper Nibbles for t RAS and t RC." This byte is crucial as it defines the most significant nibbles for the t RAS timing parameter, which corresponds to Byte twenty two, and the t RC timing parameter, associated with Byte twenty three. The values for these parameters are sourced from the DDR3 S D R A M Datasheet.

The page further details the bit allocation within these nibbles. Bits seven through four are designated for "t RC Most Significant Nibble," and the description for this portion can be found by referring to Byte twenty two. Conversely, bits three through zero are allocated for the "t RAS Most Significant Nibble," with its description available by referencing Byte twenty three.

Finally, S P D Field number twenty one is identified as defining the "Upper Nibbles for t RAS and t RC," with its definition originating from the J E D E C DDR3 S P D Specification. This systematic breakdown illustrates how critical timing information for memory operation is encoded within the S P D structure, enabling system initialization and configuration of memory controllers.
