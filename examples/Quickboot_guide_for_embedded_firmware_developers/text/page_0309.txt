The diagram illustrates the pin mapping between an Intel 5100 MCH Chipset and a DIMM. On the left, the Intel 5100 MCH Chipset is depicted with several signals: DCL K P[0], DCL K N[0], ODT[0], ODT[1], CS[0]#, CS[1]#, CS[2]#, CS[3]#, CKE[0], and CKE[1]. On the right, the DIMM side shows corresponding pins with numerical labels and signal names. Specifically, DCL K P[0] from the chipset connects to DIMM pin 185 labeled DCL K P. DCL K N[0] connects to DIMM pin 186 labeled DCL K N. ODT[0] connects to DIMM pin 195 labeled ODT 0. ODT[1] connects to DIMM pin 77 labeled ODT 1. CS[0]# connects to DIMM pin 193 labeled S0. CS[1]# connects to DIMM pin 76 labeled S1. CS[2]# connects to DIMM pin 220 labeled S2. CS[3]# connects to DIMM pin 221 labeled S3. CKE[0] connects to DIMM pin 52 labeled CKE 0. CKE[1] connects to DIMM pin 171 labeled CKE 1.

Figure 37 shows Configuration 1.1, which is Clock and Control Signal DIMM Pin Mapping. This configuration is described as One DIMM per Channel with 32 GB Mode, Quad-rank with S3 Support. Figure 37 is sourced from the Intel 5100 Platform Design Guide, specifically detailing a Single Quad-Rank DIMM equivalent.
This figure illustrates a pin mapping configuration for a memory module, specifically a Dual In line Memory Module, or D I M M, connected to an Intel 5100 Chipset. The diagram delineates the signal lines originating from the Chipset and terminating at the D I M M, showing the specific pin assignments for clock and control signals. On the left side, the Intel 5100 Chipset is represented, with signals such as D C L K P bracket zero and D C L K N bracket zero, which are differential clock signals, likely for differential signaling to improve signal integrity at high frequencies. These are depicted as originating from the Chipset. Following these are O D T bracket zero and O D T bracket one, which correspond to On Die Termination signals. These signals are crucial for impedance matching in high-speed memory interfaces, helping to minimize signal reflections and ensure data integrity. The diagram then shows Chip Select signals, C S bracket zero hash through C S bracket three hash. Chip Select signals are used by the memory controller to select specific memory devices or ranks within a memory module. The hash symbol indicates an active low signal. Lastly, C K E bracket zero and C K E bracket one represent Clock Enable signals, which are used to enable or disable the clock input to the memory devices, influencing power consumption and bus operation.

On the right side of the diagram is the D I M M, labeled D I M M zero. Each signal from the Chipset is connected to a specific pin on the D I M M, identified by a numerical pin number and a corresponding signal name. For instance, D C L K P from the Chipset maps to pin one hundred eighty five D C L K P on the D I M M, and D C L K N maps to pin one hundred eighty six D C L K N. Similarly, O D T bracket zero connects to pin one hundred ninety five O D T zero, and O D T bracket one connects to pin seventy seven O D T one. The Chip Select signals C S bracket zero hash through C S bracket three hash are mapped to pins one hundred ninety three S zero, seventy six S one, two hundred twenty S two, and two hundred twenty one S three, respectively. It is noteworthy that the signal names S zero through S three on the D I M M side are likely internal designations for the Chip Select inputs. Finally, C K E bracket zero connects to pin fifty two C K E zero, and C K E bracket one connects to pin one hundred seventy one C K E one. These mappings are in accordance with J E D E C standards for DDR two two hundred forty pin Registered D I M M Pinouts, which are industry standards that ensure interoperability between different memory components and systems. The figure caption specifies that this configuration is for one D I M M per channel, operating in a thirty two Gigabyte mode, with a Quad rank configuration, and includes S three support. This implies a complex memory subsystem capable of high capacity and performance, utilizing multiple ranks of memory per module to increase bandwidth and capacity. The term Quad rank signifies that the D I M M has four independent sets of memory chips, each addressable by the memory controller through the Chip Select signals.
