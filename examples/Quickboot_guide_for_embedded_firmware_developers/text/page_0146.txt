Once you have this file in place, there is little distinction to a normal user of
the shell between your command and an internal command. There are two

differences the user can notice:

—Internal commands take precedence over applications with the same
name. Specify the file name with the .efi extension to override this
behavior. This can also happen with script files; use .nsh to

override in this case.

—Internal commands are listed via help command. External applications

dare not.

Where to Get Shells

Shells are frequently distributed by one of two common methods: binary
distribution and code distribution. The benefits of binary distribution are

simplicity and convenience without any overhead. The benefit of code

The presented text appears to be a section from a documentation or a guide, likely related to scripting or shell programming, possibly within a specific environment such as the EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) shell. The initial block of text, `.TH <AppName> 0 "brief description"\r\n .SH NAME\r\nAdd more detailed brief description\r\n.SH SYNOPSIS\r\nAdd usage information including parameters\r\n.SH SYNOPSIS\r\nAdd a list containing each parameter and its function\r\n.SH DESCRIPTION\r\nAdd a (long) detailed description\r\n.SH EXAMPLES\r\nPut some examples here\r\n.SH RETURNVALUES\r\nSHELL_SUCCESS The action was completed as requested.\r\nAdd any more return values here.\r\n, outlines a structured format for command documentation. This structure is reminiscent of manual page (man page) formats found in Unix-like systems, where `.TH` denotes the title, `.SH` denotes a section header, and the subsequent lines provide content for each section such as NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, EXAMPLES, and RETURN VALUES. The `\r\n` sequences represent carriage return and newline characters, standard line ending conventions. The inclusion of specific section names like SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, and EXAMPLES indicates a focus on providing comprehensive information about a program or command, detailing its purpose, how to use it, and its expected behavior.

The subsequent paragraphs discuss the interaction between internal commands and external applications within a shell environment. It highlights a critical concept in command processing: command precedence. When an internal command and an external application share the same name, the internal command is executed by default. To execute the external application in such a scenario, a specific convention is often employed, such as appending a particular file extension, like `.efi` in this context, to the command name. This mechanism ensures that users can disambiguate between identically named commands, allowing for explicit selection of the desired execution context. The text also notes that internal commands are discoverable through a `help` command, differentiating them from external applications.

The section titled "Where to Get Shells" introduces the concept of shell distribution methods. It mentions two primary approaches: binary distribution and code distribution. Binary distribution involves providing pre-compiled executables, offering simplicity and convenience by eliminating the need for compilation by the end-user. Code distribution, conversely, would involve distributing the source code, requiring users to compile it themselves. The benefits of binary distribution are highlighted as simplicity and convenience without any overhead, implying that the user does not need to manage compilation toolchains or build processes. This distinction between binary and source distribution is a fundamental concept in software deployment and accessibility.
