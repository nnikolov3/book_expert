The provided data details timings associated with Dynamic Random Access Memory, specifically for DDR3 modules, and correlates these timings with specific usage designations. The core of this analysis revolves around memory latency, a critical performance metric in computer systems.

The table presents several key timing parameters. The first column, "tAAmin (MTB units)", refers to the minimum CAS (Column Address Strobe) latency, expressed in Medium Time Base units. CAS latency is a fundamental aspect of synchronous DRAM operation, representing the number of clock cycles required from when a column address is sent to the memory chip until the data is available on the data output pins. The value is given in "MTB units," which are defined elsewhere in the JEDEC specification as a base timing unit for specific memory technologies.

The second column, "MTB (ns)," provides the duration of one Medium Time Base unit in nanoseconds. This column acts as a conversion factor, allowing the "MTB units" to be translated into absolute time. For instance, if "tAAmin" is expressed in "MTB units" and the "MTB (ns)" is, say, 0.125 nanoseconds, then the absolute minimum CAS latency in nanoseconds can be calculated by multiplying these two values.

The "tAAmin Offset (FTB units)" column indicates an adjustment or offset to the base tAAmin value, measured in Fine Time Base units. The "FTB (ns)" column, similar to the MTB column, defines the duration of one Fine Time Base unit in nanoseconds. This suggests a hierarchical timing structure where offsets are also subject to a base time unit. The "tAAmin Result (ns)" column then presents the final calculated minimum CAS latency in nanoseconds, likely derived from the tAAmin value in MTB units and potentially adjusted by the offset values, all converted to nanoseconds.

The "Use" column provides a designation for the DDR3 memory, such as "DDR3-1066F," "DDR3-1333G," or "DDR3-1866M downbin." These designations are standard industry identifiers that indicate the memory's rated speed or bus frequency. For example, DDR3-1066 implies a memory bus speed of 1066 megahertz (MT/s), DDR3-1333 implies 1333 megahertz, and DDR3-1866 implies 1866 megahertz. The suffixes (F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N) often denote specific sub-timings, voltage requirements, or other characteristics that differentiate modules operating at similar nominal frequencies. The term "downbin" suggests that a particular module might be rated for a higher speed but is being utilized or specified at a lower, more conservative timing to ensure stability or compatibility, possibly due to variations in manufacturing or signaling integrity.

The notes provide crucial context. Note 1, "See SPD byte 35," points to a specific location within the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) data structure on the memory module. The SPD is a small Rom chip on a DIMM that stores vital information about the memory, which the system's C P U and memory controller read during initialization to configure the memory correctly. Byte 35 likely contains encoded timing information or a reference to other SPD bytes relevant to tAAmin. Note 2, "Refer to device datasheet for downbin support details," indicates that further specific information regarding the behavior and limitations of "downbin" configurations can be found in the manufacturer's documentation for that particular memory device.

Finally, "SPD Field #16: 'Minimum CAS Latency Time (tAAmin)' Definition from JEDEC DDR3 SPD Specification" explicitly states that the data presented is derived from JEDEC standard DDR3 specifications, specifically defining SPD Field number sixteen as the minimum CAS latency time. This reinforces the regulatory and standardized nature of these timing parameters for ensuring interoperability and predictable performance of DDR3 memory modules. The values in the table thus represent empirical data or programmed configurations for various DDR3 memory modules, demonstrating the relationship between programmed timing parameters and their actual performance characteristics or designated operating speeds.
