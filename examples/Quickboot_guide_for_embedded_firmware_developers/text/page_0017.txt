baseboard management controllers (BMCs), which are embedded
controllers that control the back-end subsystem to enhance a server
board’s ability to be remotely managed and for increased fault

tolerance.

Making a Decision on Boot Firmware

Whether a company works in the private, public, or academic space, the
firmware make-or-buy decision can be difficult without proper insight. In the
embedded space, many smaller OEMs maintain a small staff to manage
and/or develop their system firmware. Depending on the level of experience
and number of designs they have to support, they may decide to implement a
commercial BIOS product or they may try to create their own.

When a BIOS vendor is not an option, they must roll up their sleeves
and search for alternatives. In the education arena, software engineering,
computer engineering, and electrical engineering students all learn a certain
level of low-level firmware coding as part of just a few of their classes, but
most curriculums don’t include a class that takes the student through the full
experience of system firmware development. Except for some graduate level
projects, most students do not get to develop their own solutions from
scratch.

There are three basic options: BIOS vendor, reuse/borrow from open

source, from scratch.

Making a Decision on Boot Firmware

Whether a company works in the private, public, or academic space, the firmware make or buy decision can be difficult without proper insight. In the embedded space, many smaller O E Ms maintain a small staff to manage and or develop their system firmware. Depending on the level of experience and number of designs they have to support, they may decide to implement a commercial B I O S product or they may try to create their own.

When a B I O S vendor is not an option, they must roll up their sleeves and search for alternatives. In the education arena, software engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering students all learn a certain level of low level firmware coding as part of just a few of their classes, but most curriculums don't include a class that takes the student through the full experience of system firmware development. Except for some graduate level projects, most students do not get to develop their own solutions from scratch. There are three basic options: B I O S vendor, reuse or borrow from open source, or from scratch.

Consider Using a B I O S Vendor
Baseboard Management Controllers, often referred to as B M C s, represent a critical category of embedded systems within server architectures. These are specialized microcontrollers physically present on the motherboard, operating largely independently of the host C P U and operating system. Their core function is to facilitate out-of-band management of the server, meaning they enable administrators to monitor and control the server's back end subsystem even if the main C P U is powered off, unresponsive, or experiencing critical errors. This capability is paramount for achieving high availability and fault tolerance in data centers, as it allows for remote power cycling, K V M over I P access, hardware health monitoring—such as temperature, fan speeds, and voltage—and even remote operating system installation or re-installation. The B M C typically has its own dedicated network interface and a separate power plane, ensuring its operational independence and robustness for critical infrastructure management. The value-add firmware residing on the B M C is what provides this extensive management functionality, translating low-level hardware signals and commands into a manageable interface.

The subsequent discussion centers on the strategic "make or buy" decision pertaining to boot firmware, which encompasses the Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, and its more modern successor, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I. This decision is particularly complex for Original Equipment Manufacturers, or O E M s, operating in the embedded systems space, due to the profound impact boot firmware has on system functionality, reliability, and security. Boot firmware is the very first software executed by a processor upon system power-on. Its fundamental role is to initialize and configure the underlying hardware, perform essential power on self tests, and ultimately hand over control to a boot loader that initiates the operating system. This low level interaction with diverse hardware components—from the C P U and memory controllers to peripheral I O interfaces—demands highly specialized expertise.

Developing and maintaining robust system firmware from scratch presents significant technical and resource challenges. It requires extensive knowledge of hardware registers, timing constraints, and platform specific quirks, as well as rigorous testing across numerous hardware configurations to ensure compatibility and stability. Smaller O E M s often lack the specialized staff and extensive engineering resources necessary to undertake such a complex endeavor across a potentially large number of distinct hardware designs. This is further exacerbated by the reality that, within academic curricula in computer science, software engineering, and electrical engineering, comprehensive, hands-on experience in full system firmware development is typically limited. While students gain a foundational understanding of low level programming and computer architecture, the full life cycle of boot firmware development, from initial hardware bring up to long term maintenance and security patching, is usually explored only in advanced graduate level studies or specialized industrial projects.

Given these challenges, O E M s generally consider three primary approaches for their boot firmware strategy. The first is to engage with a commercial B I O S vendor. This involves licensing a proprietary B I O S or U E F I product that can be customized to the O E M's specific hardware platform. The technical advantages include significantly reduced development time and engineering cost, access to the vendor's deep expertise in platform enablement and compatibility, and often, faster time to market. Commercial vendors typically provide extensive support for compliance with industry standards, security vulnerabilities, and new hardware feature integration, abstracting much of this complexity from the O E M.

The second option involves leveraging open source boot firmware projects. Examples include U E F I E D K two, which provides a framework for U E F I development, or coreboot, a more minimalist open source alternative. This approach offers benefits such as reduced or eliminated licensing costs, greater transparency into the code base, and enhanced flexibility for customization to meet unique system requirements. It also fosters a collaborative development environment where multiple parties can contribute to improvements and bug fixes. However, adopting open source firmware necessitates a substantial internal engineering capability within the O E M to integrate, adapt, debug, and maintain the code. While the source code is freely available, the responsibility for ensuring its stability, security, and compatibility with proprietary hardware components or specific operating system features ultimately rests with the O E M. This often requires significant reverse engineering and driver development efforts.

The third and most technically arduous option is to develop the system firmware entirely from scratch. This approach grants an O E M complete control over every aspect of the boot process, enabling extreme optimization for performance, power efficiency, or stringent security requirements unique to their product. It also allows for the implementation of highly specialized or innovative features that are not available in commercial or open source offerings. However, the associated engineering investment is extraordinarily high, demanding a team with profound and diverse expertise in processor instruction set architectures, memory subsystem design, peripheral control, and low level boot protocols. This path incurs the longest development cycles, the highest R and D costs, and an ongoing, substantial burden for maintenance, bug fixes, security updates, and compatibility testing across evolving hardware and software landscapes. Consequently, developing boot firmware from scratch is typically reserved for highly specialized, mission critical, or extremely high volume applications where the unique requirements cannot be met by other solutions.
