Raw card design used.
The presented data establishes a mapping between binary codes and corresponding descriptors, specifically labels for "Reference raw" data associated with different "card" designations. This enumeration suggests a system where specific configurations or states of hardware components, referred to as "cards," are identified by unique binary sequences.

The binary sequence "one zero one one" maps to "Reference raw card A D." Following this, "one one zero zero" signifies "Reference raw card A E," and "one one zero one" corresponds to "Reference raw card A F." This pattern continues with "one one one zero" for "Reference raw card A G," and "one zero one one" again, this time associated with "Reference raw card A H." It is important to note the repetition of the binary code "one zero one one" for distinct card labels. Then, "one one one zero zero" maps to "Reference raw card A J," and "one one one zero one" maps to "Reference raw card A K." Subsequently, "one one one one zero" represents "Reference raw card A L." Finally, the binary sequence "one one one one one" signifies "Z Z (no J E D E C reference raw card design used)."

The term "Reference raw" likely indicates a baseline or default state of the hardware component, perhaps representing unconfigured or factory default data. The use of binary codes as identifiers points to a low-level control or configuration mechanism within a larger system. These codes could be used for device identification, status reporting, or as inputs to control logic within a digital circuit or embedded system. The mention of J E D E C, which refers to the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, suggests that the "Z Z" designation might represent a non-standard or custom configuration, bypassing established industry standards for memory or storage devices. This implies a level of flexibility or customization in the system's hardware design or operational modes. The data structure is essentially a lookup table, mapping input binary values to descriptive strings, which is a fundamental concept in computer science for representing categorical data or state information.
