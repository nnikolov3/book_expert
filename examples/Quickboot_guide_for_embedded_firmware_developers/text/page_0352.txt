The presented table details timing parameters for DDR3 memory, specifically comparing different speed bins: DDR3-800, DDR3-1066, DDR3-1333, and DDR3-1600. These timings are critical for ensuring reliable data transfer between the C P U and the memory modules, as they define the minimum or maximum allowable durations for various operations in terms of clock cycles or absolute time units like picoseconds and nanoseconds.

The table is structured with a "Parameter" column, a "Symbol" column, and then columns for each DDR3 speed bin, subdivided into "Min" and "Max" values, and finally a "Units" column. The "Units" column indicates whether the timing is measured in clock cycles (CK) or picoseconds (ps).

Let's examine some key parameters. The "DQS, DQS # differential READ postamble" is given in clock cycles. For DDR3-800 and DDR3-1066, it's a minimum of zero point three clock cycles, with a note indicating "Note 27" for the maximum value, suggesting specific conditional or supplemental definitions. For DDR3-1333, it's zero point three clock cycles minimum, and for DDR3-1600, it's again zero point three clock cycles minimum, with "Note 27" for the maximum. This parameter relates to the signal integrity and timing of the data strobe during read operations.

Under "Command and Address Timings," we see several critical parameters. "DLL locking time" is measured in clock cycles. For all speed bins, it's five hundred twelve clock cycles, indicating a synchronization process for the delay lock loop, which is essential for accurate timing recovery.

Setup times, such as "CTRL, CMD, ADDR setup," are often specified in picoseconds. For instance, for the DDR3-800 speed bin, the base setup time is two hundred picoseconds, while the specified setup time is three hundred seventy-five picoseconds. As the speed increases, these setup times generally decrease, reflecting the tighter timing margins required at higher frequencies. For DDR3-1600, the specified setup time is two hundred forty picoseconds, a reduction from the lower speed bins. These setup times are fundamental to the setup and hold time requirements of synchronous sequential logic, ensuring that data is stable when the clock edge arrives.

Pulse width parameters, like "Minimum CTRL, CMD, ADDR pulse width," are also crucial. For example, the minimum pulse width for DDR3-800 is nine hundred picoseconds. This ensures that control signals are sufficiently long to be reliably recognized by the memory interface.

The table also shows relationships between different timing parameters. For instance, "ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay" and "PRECHARGE command period" are referenced to "See Speed Bin Tables (page 72)" for RCD, RP, and RAS timings. These are typically measured in nanoseconds. The RCD, or Row Address to Column Address Delay, RP, or Row Precharge time, and RAS, or Row Active time, are fundamental to DRAM operation, defining the time between activating a row and accessing columns within that row, and the time required to precharge a row before activating a new one.

Other parameters, like "ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE command" and "ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE minimum command period," are defined based on multiples of clock cycles and specific durations, often depending on page size. For example, the minimum command period for ACTIVATE commands can be specified as the greater of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds. These timings are crucial for managing the refresh and row activation cycles in DRAM, directly impacting memory bandwidth and latency.

The "Write recovery time" is defined as the minimum time required after a write operation before another operation can commence. The "Delay from start of internal WRITE transaction to internal READ command" is also a significant timing parameter, measured as the greater of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds for DDR3-1600. Similarly, the "READ to PRECHARGE time" and "CAS to CAS command delay" are defined. The "CAS to CAS command delay" for DDR3-1600 is a minimum of four clock cycles and a maximum of not applicable. The "Auto precharge write recovery plus precharge time" and the "MODE REGISTER SET command cycle time" are also specified, contributing to the overall operational efficiency and stability of the memory system. These parameters collectively define the intricate dance of signals and timing that governs high-speed memory operation.
