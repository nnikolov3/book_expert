The presented information details a critical aspect of memory system configuration, specifically focusing on the signaling for DDR3 S D R A M ranks. The core concept revolves around address mapping, a fundamental principle in computer architecture that dictates how logical addresses generated by the processor are translated into physical memory locations.

At a high level, the text describes register commands used to configure these memory ranks. It highlights a specific setting: "Reserved Rank 1 Mapping." This setting is controlled by "Bit 0," which can assume one of two states: "0" indicating a "standard" mapping and "1" indicating a "mirrored" mapping. This binary control mechanism is a common method for selecting between different operational modes or configurations within hardware.

The distinction between standard and mirrored address mapping is elaborated upon through a tabular representation of "Edge Connector Signal D R A M Pin Standard D R A M Pin Mirrored." This table illustrates how address signals, labeled from A0 up to A15/B A 3, are routed to the physical pins of the D R A M modules. In a standard configuration, the address signals are mapped directly, meaning A0 on the edge connector corresponds to A0 on the D R A M, A1 to A1, and so forth.

The mirrored mapping, however, presents a permutation of these signals. For instance, while A0 remains A0, A1 maps to A1, A2 maps to A2, and A3 on the edge connector maps to A4 on the D R A M. Then, A4 maps to A3, A5 maps to A6, and A6 maps to A5. This pattern continues through the address bus, with specific pairs of address lines being swapped. The purpose of mirrored addressing is often to improve signal integrity or to facilitate specific memory interleaving schemes, which can enhance data throughput by allowing concurrent access to different parts of the memory. The table also includes bank address signals, B A 0, B A 1, and B A 2, which are also subject to this mirroring, demonstrating that the entire address command structure can be remapped. The "highlighted rows" mentioned in the text would typically indicate the specific signal mappings that differ between the standard and mirrored configurations, drawing attention to the changes introduced by the mirroring. This detailed mapping is crucial for the memory controller to correctly interpret and issue commands to the memory modules, ensuring data is accessed from the intended physical locations.
