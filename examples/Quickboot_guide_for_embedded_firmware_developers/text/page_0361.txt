The document presents timing parameters and addressing configurations for synchronous dynamic random access memory, commonly known as S D Ram. These parameters are crucial for ensuring the correct and efficient operation of memory interfaces within a computing system.

The first section details various timing parameters, each defined by a specific mnemonic and expressed as a minimum number of clock cycles, denoted as C K. For instance, the delay from the start of an internal write transaction to an internal read command, denoted as 'W T R', requires a minimum of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds, whichever is greater. Similarly, the read to precharge time, 'R T P', also mandates a minimum of four C K or seven point five nanoseconds. The CAS hash to CAS hash command delay, 'C C D', specifies a minimum of four C K and a maximum of four C K. The auto precharge write recovery plus precharge time, 'D A L', is defined as the write command plus the read precharge time ('W R' plus 'R P') in clock cycles, averaged over the operations. The mode register set command cycle time, 'M R D', requires a minimum of four C K and a maximum of four C K. Finally, the command update delay, 'M O D', needs a minimum of twelve C K or fifteen nanoseconds. These parameters represent critical timing constraints that must be adhered to by the memory controller to prevent data corruption or operational failures.

Table two, titled "Addressing," illustrates how memory addressing schemes vary across different S D Ram configurations. It compares three configurations: five hundred twelve megabytes multiplied by four data lines, two hundred fifty six megabytes multiplied by eight data lines, and one hundred twenty eight megabytes multiplied by sixteen data lines. For each configuration, it specifies the overall memory organization in terms of capacity and data bus width, along with the number of banks. It then details the size of the row addressing and bank addressing fields. For example, in the five hundred twelve megabytes multiplied by four configuration, the row addressing is sixty four megabytes multiplied by four banks, requiring thirty two address bits, and the bank addressing uses eight bits, specifically Bank Address bits two through zero. The column addressing is two thousand four hundred forty eight bits multiplied by eleven through nine. As the data bus width increases, the row and column addressing schemes adjust to accommodate larger capacities and different internal memory structures. For instance, the one hundred twenty eight megabytes multiplied by sixteen configuration has sixteen megabytes multiplied by sixteen banks, with sixteen thousand row address bits and sixteen thousand column address bits, indicating a different internal bank organization and addressing logic.

The document then delves into specific Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, fields relevant to S D Ram capabilities. S P D Field twenty nine, labeled as "Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time (tFAWmin) LSB," is cited from a Micron M T four one J two fifty six M eight datasheet. This field, likely representing the least significant byte of the tFAWmin timing parameter, is an example of how vendor-specific timing details are communicated through S P D.

Following this, S P D Field zero times one E is identified as representing S D Ram Optional Features. The accompanying text explains that three bits within this field are designated to indicate the support for various features. The example provided shows that these three bits, when set to zero times eighty three in hexadecimal, indicate support for R Z Q seven, R Z Q six, and D L L Off Mode. This signifies that these optional features are enabled or supported by the particular S D Ram module based on the encoded values in the S P D data. This mechanism allows system memory controllers to dynamically configure themselves based on the capabilities of the installed memory modules.
