Byte twenty eight bits three dash zero, Byte twenty nine bits seven dash zero: Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time t F A W M T B Units. Values defined from one to four thousand and ninety five. Examples:
The provided document details a specific register field related to DRAM memory timing, specifically the "Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time" (tFAWmin). This parameter is crucial for ensuring stable operation of modern high-speed memory systems, particularly with Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DDR SDRAM.

The table outlines that Byte 29, when considered as part of a larger bit field, defines this critical timing parameter. Specifically, Byte 29 contains the Least Significant Byte of the value, and its lower nibble, combined with Byte 28's upper nibble, forms a 12-bit value. This 12-bit field represents the tFAWmin in Medium Timebase (MTB) units. The typical value for this parameter is shown as hexadecimal two C, translating to thirty two in decimal, and its definition is thirty seven point five nanoseconds.

The concept of the "Four Activate Window" refers to the minimum time interval that must exist between consecutive "Activate" commands issued to a memory bank within a DDR SDRAM module. An Activate command is used to open a row within a memory bank, making its contents accessible for subsequent read or write operations. DDR SDRAM operates with complex timing relationships between these commands to achieve high data throughput. The tFAW parameter dictates the minimum allowable separation to prevent data corruption or operational errors, ensuring that the memory controller respects the internal refresh and precharge cycles required by the DRAM cells.

The value of this parameter is derived from the DDR3 SDRAM datasheet. Furthermore, the specific value is dependent on the SDRAM page size. The page size refers to the size of the contiguous block of memory within a row that can be accessed before a new row needs to be activated. Different memory configurations and densities can have varying page sizes, which in turn influence the optimal tFAW setting. To accurately determine the page size, one would consult the relevant section of the DDR3 SDRAM datasheet.

The text further elaborates that Byte 28 Bits three through zero, along with Byte 29 Bits seven through zero, collectively define the Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time. This implies a specific bit arrangement within the register, where Byte 28 holds the most significant bits and Byte 29 holds the least significant bits of the 12-bit timing value. The values for this timing parameter are defined to range from one to four thousand ninety five MTB units. The Medium Timebase (MTB) unit is a fundamental clock period used to express various timing parameters in SDRAM, abstracting the actual clock frequency into a standardized unit. The conversion from MTB units to actual nanoseconds is typically provided in the memory datasheet, as demonstrated by the thirty seven point five nanosecond typical value.

Understanding and configuring these timing parameters is essential for the memory controller to correctly interact with the DDR SDRAM. Incorrectly set timing parameters can lead to unpredictable behavior, memory errors, and system instability. Therefore, these values are carefully specified by memory manufacturers and must be adhered to by system designers.
