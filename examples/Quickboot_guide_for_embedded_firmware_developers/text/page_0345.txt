This table details timing parameters for dynamic random access memory modules, specifically focusing on the tRC, or Minimum Active to Active/Refresh Time, and its constituent components. The values presented are derived from specific bit fields within a larger data structure, identified as Byte 21 Bits 7 through 4 and Byte 23 Bits 7 through 0. These fields are used to define a base timing unit, referred to as MTB units, where the values shown range from one to forty ninety five.

The table columns represent key timing metrics and their resultant values. The first column, tRC (MTB units), indicates the base tRC value expressed in these defined units. Following this is the MTB column, which quantifies the unit of time in nanoseconds, or ns, used for the tRC measurement. For instance, a value of zero point one two five ns signifies the duration of one MTB unit. The next column, tRC Offset (FTB units), introduces an adjustment to the base tRC value, measured in FTB units. FTB, likely standing for Fine Timing Bits, represents a finer granularity of time measurement. The subsequent FTB (ns) column indicates the duration of one FTB unit in nanoseconds.

The tRC Result column then provides the calculated effective tRC, likely derived from the base tRC, MTB, and tRC Offset values, expressed in nanoseconds. This is the actual timing parameter that governs memory operations. Finally, the Use column provides a designation for the specific memory type or configuration associated with each timing set, such as DDR3 eight hundred D, DDR3 eight hundred E, and progressively higher frequencies like DDR3 one thousand sixty six E through DDR3 two thousand one hundred thirty three N.

Analyzing the data, we observe a correlation between the tRC values and the memory speed grades. For example, lower tRC results, such as fifty nanoseconds, are associated with DDR3 eight hundred D modules, while higher tRC results, like forty five nanoseconds, are seen with DDR3 one thousand six hundred G modules. The tRC Offset column shows variations, with some entries being zero, indicating no offset, and others displaying negative values, such as minus fifty or minus one hundred five. These negative offsets, when combined with the FTB conversion, effectively shorten the overall tRC, allowing for faster operation or accommodating specific memory controller configurations. The presence of entries like "downbin" suggests that certain configurations might represent binning or selection processes to meet specific performance targets. The consistent zero values in the FTB (ns) column for the tRC Offset indicate that the FTB unit itself is a fixed quantum of time, and the offset is a count of these quanta. The tRC Result column demonstrates how these offsets, when translated to nanoseconds using the FTB unit, modify the base timing. For instance, a tRC Offset of minus fifty with an FTB unit of zero point zero zero one ns would reduce the effective tRC by fifty nanoseconds. This table provides a critical mapping between encoded timing parameters in memory control registers and the actual temporal requirements for reliable memory operation across various DDR3 speed grades.
