The diagram illustrates the functionality of Mode Register 2, or M R two, a component within the address bus structure. The address bus is depicted with signals labeled B A two through B A zero, A one three through A one zero, and A nine through A zero, all connected to corresponding bits of the M R two register. The M R two register itself is shown as a collection of bits from seventeen down to zero.

The diagram breaks down the M R two register into different functional blocks. The M one six, M one five bits control the "Mode Register." When M one six and M one five are both zero, it indicates "Mode register set zero (M R zero)." When M one six is zero and M one five is one, it signifies "Mode register set one (M R one)." If M one six is one and M one five is zero, it refers to "Mode register set two (M R two)." Finally, when both M one six and M one five are one, it denotes "Mode register set three (M R three)."

To the right of this, the M one zero, M zero bits are associated with "CAS Write Latency (C W L)." The options provided are five C K where the clock cycle is greater than or equal to two point five nanoseconds, and six C K where the clock cycle is greater than or equal to one point eight seven five nanoseconds and less than one point two five nanoseconds. There are also entries labeled "Reserved" for other bit combinations.

Another section, controlled by M seven, pertains to "Self Refresh Temperature." A value of zero in M seven means "Normal (zero degrees Celsius to eighty five degrees Celsius)." A value of one indicates "Extended (zero degrees Celsius to ninety five degrees Celsius)."

The M nine bits relate to "Dynamic O D T (R T Tnom)." A value of zero means "R T Tnom disabled." A value of one sets it to "R Z Q divided by four." A value of zero for M eight, which is part of this section, means "R Z Q divided by two," and a value of one indicates "Reserved."

The M six bit is for "Auto Self Refresh (Optional)." A zero value means "Disabled Manual," while a one value means "Enabled Automatic."

The notes clarify that M R two bits seventeen, fourteen through twelve, and two through zero are reserved for future use and must be programmed to zero. On die revision A, A S R is not available, and M R two bit six must be programmed to a zero. If operating self refresh mode above eighty five degrees Celsius, use S R T, M R two bit seven.

The text then describes "Extended Temperature Usage." It states that Micron's D D R three S D Ram supports the optional extended temperature range of zero degrees Celsius to plus ninety five degrees Celsius. Thus, the S R T and A S R options must be used at a minimum.

Figure fifty five displays the "Mode Register two (M R two) Definition."

Following this is "S P D Field thirty one: SDRAM Thermal and Refresh Options Example from Micron M T forty one J two fifty six M eight Datasheet."

Next, "Byte thirty two: Module Thermal Sensor" is presented. This byte describes the module's supported thermal options.

The options are detailed for "Bit seven: Thermal Sensor one." A value of zero indicates "Thermal sensor not incorporated onto this assembly." A value of one signifies "Thermal sensor incorporated onto this assembly."

For "Bits six to zero: Thermal Sensor Accuracy," a value of zero means "Undefined." All other settings are defined to be.
The diagram illustrates the definition of Mode Register 2, also known as M R two, in a DDR S D R a M context. This register is configured through an address bus, with specific bits influencing its operational parameters. The top portion of the diagram shows the address bus lines, labeled from B A two down to B A zero and then A fourteen through A zero, indicating the multiplexed address and command signals characteristic of DDR memory interfaces. Mode Register 2 itself is depicted as a register with bits M sixteen down to M zero.

The configuration of M R two involves setting specific bits to control various functions. For instance, bits M sixteen and M fifteen are shown to select different mode register sets: zero zero selects M R zero, zero one selects M R one, one zero selects M R two, and one one selects M R three. This implies a hierarchical or banked approach to register selection within the memory device. Bits M ten and M nine are associated with Dynamic O D T, or On Die Termination, and their values control different termination resistance ratios, such as R T O P W disabled or R Z Q divided by four, R Z Q divided by two. A value of one in M ten and zero in M nine selects R Z Q divided by two for termination, which is crucial for signal integrity by matching the characteristic impedance of the transmission lines.

Bits M seven, M six, and M five relate to Self Refresh, specifically the Auto Self Refresh, or A S R, functionality. Bit M seven, labeled T R T T O P W, and bits M six and M five are involved in temperature-dependent refresh rate control. A value of zero in M seven appears to be reserved or related to a temperature threshold. The diagram indicates that M R two bit M six is for S R T A S R, likely referring to a Self Refresh Temperature feature.

Furthermore, bits M five and M four define the C W L, or C A S Write Latency. A setting of zero zero for M five and M four specifies a latency of five C K, where C K represents the clock cycle duration, with a specific constraint of C K being greater than or equal to two point five nanoseconds. A setting of zero one for M five and M four indicates a latency of six C K, with a constraint of C K being greater than or equal to one point eight seven five nanoseconds. This latency parameter is fundamental to the timing of write operations in a DDR memory system, ensuring data is stable before being captured by the memory array. The remaining bits, M three through M zero, are also depicted as part of the mode register configuration, with specific assignments such as M three and M two likely controlling other operational aspects.

The notes accompanying the diagram provide crucial context. Note one states that M R two, bits seventeen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, eight, and two through zero are reserved for future use and must be programmed to zero. This signifies that only a subset of the bits in M R two is currently defined and actively used for configuration. Note two highlights that on die revision A, S R T A S R is not available, and M R two bit six must be programmed to zero. However, if operating in self refresh mode, M R two bit seven should be used. This indicates that feature availability can be revision-dependent and that specific bits have conditional functionality.

The text below the diagram, "Extended Temperature Usage," elaborates on Micron's D D R three S D R a M support for an extended temperature range, from zero degrees Celsius to ninety five degrees Celsius. It also states that the S R T and A S R options must be used at a minimum, suggesting that these features are mandatory for operating within this extended temperature range to ensure reliable performance and thermal management.

Following this, "S P D Field #31: SDRAM Thermal and Refresh Options" from the Micron M T forty one J two hundred fifty six M eight Datasheet is mentioned. This points to a specific field within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure that contains information about the thermal and refresh configurations of the memory module.

Subsequently, "Byte 32: Module Thermal Sensor" is described. This byte within the S P D data is dedicated to conveying information about the module's supported thermal sensor capabilities. Specifically, Bit seven, labeled "Thermal Sensor one," indicates whether a thermal sensor is incorporated onto the assembly. A value of zero signifies that the thermal sensor is not incorporated, while a value of one means it is incorporated. Bits six through zero, under the heading "Thermal Sensor Accuracy," provide information on the accuracy of the thermal sensor. A setting of zero for these bits means "Undefined," suggesting that the accuracy is not specified or applicable in this case. Any other settings for these bits are defined to be used in other ways, implying a range of possible accuracy specifications or states depending on the memory module's design and the overall system's requirements for thermal monitoring. This detailed bit-level configuration is essential for the system's BIOS or firmware to correctly initialize and manage the memory subsystem, especially concerning thermal control and refresh rate adjustments to maintain optimal operation across varying environmental conditions.
