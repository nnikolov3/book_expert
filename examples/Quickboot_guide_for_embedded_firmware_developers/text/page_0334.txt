(trrpmin)‚Äù Example from Micron MT41J256M8 Datasheet

SPD Field 0x14: Min. Row Precharge Delay (tppmin)

This is another field that must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by

the Medium Timebase Divisor.

In our example:

1.
The typ value found in the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet for our
specific SDRAM chip gives 13.125 ns.
2.
This number must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, the
value in 0x0B. In our example this is 0.125 ns.
3.
13.125 ns/0.125 ns = 105 = 0x69.

Byte 20: Minimum Row Precharge Delay Time (tRPmin)

This byte defines the minimum SDRAM Row Precharge Delay Time in
Medium Timebase (MTB) units. This value comes from the DDR3 SDRAM
datasheet.

S P D Field zero x one four: Min. Row Precharge Delay T R P min.

This is another field that must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor.

In our example:

one. The T R P value found in the Micron M T four one J two five six M eight datasheet for our specific S D Ram chip gives thirteen point one two five ns.

two. This number must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, the value in zero x zero B. In our example this is zero point one two five ns.

three. Thirteen point one two five ns divided by zero point one two five ns is equal to one zero five which is equal to zero x zero six nine.

The table shows fields related to byte information and their definitions. The first row details Byte two zero in decimal and zero x one four in hexadecimal. This corresponds to the Field Name Min. Row Precharge Delay T R P min. The Typical Value for this field is zero x zero six nine and the Definition provided is thirteen point one two five ns.

Byte twenty: Minimum Row Precharge Delay Time T R P min. This byte defines the minimum S D Ram Row Precharge Delay Time in Medium Timebase M T B units. This value comes from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet.
This document describes the extraction and interpretation of a specific timing parameter, the minimum row precharge delay, denoted as t R R D min, from a Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet. This parameter is stored within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure of a memory module, and is specifically located in field zero through fourteen, hexadecimal zero through hexadecimal F. The value represents the minimum time required to precharge a row in a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or S D R a m, chip.

The process of extracting this value involves referencing a specific datasheet and utilizing a medium timebase divisor. The example illustrates that a t R P value found in the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds. This raw value is then processed by dividing it by the medium timebase divisor, which in this particular example is specified as hexadecimal zero B. The calculation thirteen point one two five nanoseconds divided by zero point one two five nanoseconds yields a result of one hundred and five. This value is then converted to its hexadecimal representation, which is hexadecimal sixty nine.

The provided table details this process. It shows that byte twenty, represented numerically as twenty and in hexadecimal as hexadecimal one four, corresponds to the field name "Min. Row Precharge Delay (t R P min)". The typical value stored for this field is shown as hexadecimal sixty nine, and its definition is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds. This byte, byte twenty, specifically defines the minimum S D R a m row precharge delay in units of the medium timebase. This specific timing characteristic is derived from the DDR3 S D R a m datasheet, highlighting the importance of cross-referencing device-specific documentation for accurate parameter interpretation. This process is fundamental in configuring memory controllers and ensuring proper memory operation within a system's architecture, as timing parameters are critical for maintaining data integrity and achieving optimal performance.
