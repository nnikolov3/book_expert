Figure two dot one illustrates the Intel Pentium Pro Architecture, depicting a system's core components and their interconnections. At the center of the diagram are the C P U, North Bridge, and South Bridge, forming the main communication backbone.

The C P U connects to the North Bridge via F S B s, which stands for Front Side Bus. The North Bridge also directly interfaces with D Ram, providing one, two, or four channels for memory access. For graphics, a G F X component is connected to the North Bridge through a P C I E times sixteen link. The North Bridge communicates with the South Bridge via a comprehensive bus, labeled Hublink slash D M I slash C S I slash P C I slash P C I X slash P C I E Bus.

The South Bridge serves as a hub for various peripheral devices. It connects to Hard Drivers, U S B devices, and a cluster of common input output peripherals including the Mouse, Keyboard, and Floppy drives. Additionally, the South Bridge provides connectivity for Audio and L A N devices. It also interfaces with the B I O S and the S I O, which typically manages slower peripheral devices. The diagram generalizes other connections from the South Bridge under the label "Just About Everything Else."

Below the diagram, several technologies in the C P U are noted to have an initialization impact. One such technology is multi core architecture, which separates real time and non real time tasks to improve response time. There are different implementations of this approach.
The architecture illustrated depicts a foundational design for computer systems, characteristic of the Intel Pentium Pro era, showcasing a hierarchical bus structure centered around a chipset composed of a North Bridge and a South Bridge. At the apex of this hierarchy, conceptually and often physically on the motherboard, resides the Central Processing Unit, or C P U. The C P U connects directly to the North Bridge via the Front Side Bus, or F S B. This F S B is the primary communication pathway for the C P U to access the rest of the system.

Positioned below the C P U and centrally located in the diagram, the North Bridge acts as the high-speed controller, mediating access to performance-critical components. It directly interfaces with the C P U via the F S B and manages connections to the main system memory, typically D Ram, through one, two, or four memory channels. The number of channels determines the memory bandwidth, with more channels allowing for greater concurrent data transfer. To the left of the North Bridge, a dedicated, high-bandwidth connection, specifically a sixteen lane P C I E link, is allocated for the Graphics Processing Unit, or G F X, emphasizing the growing importance of accelerated graphics in computing. This direct connection minimizes latency and maximizes throughput for demanding visual workloads.

The North Bridge, in turn, is linked to the South Bridge, positioned directly below it in the diagram, through a proprietary high-speed interconnect. Historically, this link has been known by various names such as Hublink, D M I, or C S I, depending on the generation and vendor. This interconnect serves as the primary bus for slower, less performance-critical peripherals and general purpose I O. The South Bridge manages a multitude of diverse I O interfaces, fanning out to various devices. To its left, connections are shown for Hard Drivers, typically utilizing A T A or S A T A interfaces, and U S B ports for connecting a wide array of external peripherals. Further down and to the left, a block labeled "Mouse, Keyboard, Floppy" and "Just About Everything Else" represents a collection of legacy and miscellaneous I O devices, often managed by a Super I O, or S I O, chip, which is depicted below the South Bridge and to its right.

To the right of the South Bridge, connections are extended for integrated peripherals such as Audio controllers and L A N network interfaces. The South Bridge also directly interfaces with the B I O S, or Basic I O System, which is a firmware component depicted below the South Bridge and to its left. The B I O S contains the initial boot instructions and basic hardware initialization routines essential for system startup. The S I O chip, connected to the South Bridge, typically handles the legacy serial and parallel ports, keyboard, mouse, and floppy disk drive controllers, consolidating these lower speed I O functions. This dual-chipset architecture separates high-speed, latency-sensitive operations from slower I O, optimizing system performance by preventing bottlenecks on the primary data paths to the C P U and memory. Modern system architectures have largely integrated the North Bridge's functionality, particularly the memory controller and P C I E lanes, directly into the C P U itself, eliminating the F S B as a separate entity and reducing communication latency. The South Bridge functionality has evolved into what is now often referred to as a Platform Controller Hub, or P C H.

Complementing this hardware architecture, particularly within the C P U itself, is the advent of multi-core design. A multi-core architecture fundamentally involves integrating multiple independent processing units, or cores, onto a single chip. Each core can execute instructions concurrently, enabling true parallel processing. This design paradigm addresses the challenge of improving performance beyond the limits of increasing single core clock frequencies, by exploiting parallelism at the instruction, thread, and process levels. A key benefit of multi-core systems is the ability to separate different categories of computational tasks. Specifically, the separation of real time and non real time tasks is crucial for improving system response time and predictability. Real time tasks are characterized by strict timing constraints, where operations must be completed within specific, often very short, deadlines to ensure correct system behavior. Examples include industrial control systems, automotive electronics, or multimedia streaming where missing a deadline can lead to catastrophic failure or unacceptable degradation of quality of service. Non real time tasks, conversely, have more flexible deadlines and can tolerate variable execution times; typical desktop applications or background processes fall into this category.

By allocating real time tasks to dedicated cores, or sets of cores, the system can ensure their timely execution by isolating them from the potentially variable demands of non real time workloads. This isolation mitigates interference from less critical tasks, such as cache contention, bus contention, or scheduler preemption, which could otherwise delay real time operations. This approach improves the determinism of real time responses. Different implementations of this separation can involve various scheduling policies, hypervisor-based partitioning, or operating system support for real time extensions, all aimed at guaranteeing resources and execution windows for critical tasks while still allowing less critical tasks to run opportunistically on other cores.
