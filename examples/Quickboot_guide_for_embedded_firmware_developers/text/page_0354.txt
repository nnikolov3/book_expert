Byte 27: Minimum Internal Read to Precharge Command Delay Time
(tRTPmin)

This byte defines the minimum SDRAM Internal Read to Precharge Delay
Time in Medium Timebase (MTB) units. This value comes from the DDR3
SDRAM datasheet. The value of this number may depend on the SDRAM
page size; please refer to the DDR3 SDRAM datasheet section on Addressing
to determine the page size for these devices. Controller designers must also
note that at some frequencies, a minimum number of clocks may be required,
resulting in a larger tRTPmin value than indicated in the SPD. For example,
tRTPmin for DDR3-800 must be 4 clocks.

Bits 7-0

Byte twenty seven: Minimum Internal Read to Precharge Command Delay Time (t R T P min). This byte defines the minimum S D R A M Internal Read to Precharge Delay Time in Medium Timebase units. This value comes from the D D R three S D R A M datasheet. The value of this number may depend on the S D R A M page size. Please refer to the D D R three S D R A M datasheet section on Addressing to determine the page size for these devices. Controller designers must also note that at some frequencies, a minimum number of clocks may be required, resulting in a larger t R T P min value than indicated in the S P D. For example, t R T P min for D D R three minus eight hundred must be four clocks.

Bits seven through zero: Internal Read to Precharge Delay Time (t R T P) M T B Units. Values defined from one to two hundred fifty five.

Examples: The table shows an example with sixty t R T P (M T B units), which corresponds to hexadecimal three C in timebase, resulting in seven point five nanoseconds for the t R T P result, and is used for all D D R three S D R A M speed bins.

Note: t R T P is at least four n C K independent of operating frequency.

The presented information details Byte 27 of a system's Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, which defines the minimum internal read to precharge command delay time, denoted as t R T Pmin. This timing parameter is critical for the correct operation of Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D D R three S D Ram. The value for t R T Pmin is expressed in Medium Timebase, or M T B, units. The precise value of this timing parameter is often derived from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet, and controller designers must consult this documentation to accurately determine the appropriate page size for these memory devices. It is also noted that at certain operating frequencies, a larger t R T Pmin value might be necessary than what is indicated in the S P D. As an illustrative example, for D D R3-800 memory, the t R T Pmin is specified as four clock cycles.

The specific bits that define this delay are Bits 7 through 0, and these are internally interpreted as the Internal Read to Precharge Delay Time in M T B units, with values ranging from one to two hundred fifty five. An example is provided to clarify the conversion: when t R T P is set to sixty M T B units, corresponding to a hexadecimal value of zero x three C, and the timebase is zero point one two five nanoseconds, the resulting t R T P value is seven point five nanoseconds. This particular setting is applicable to all D D R three S D Ram speed bins.

A crucial note is that the t R T P value is at least four D D R three clock cycles, or n C K, and this minimum is independent of the operating frequency. This detail is vital for ensuring stable memory operation across different performance profiles.

The document further references S P D Field number twenty seven, which is explicitly titled "Minimum Internal Read to Precharge Command Delay Time (t R T Pmin)". This field's definition originates from the J E D E C D D R3 S P D Specification. The information presented is part of a larger context, as indicated by "Table fifty six Electrical Characteristics and A C Operating Conditions (Continued)", suggesting that notes one through eight apply to the entire table, providing a comprehensive set of parameters for memory system design and validation.
