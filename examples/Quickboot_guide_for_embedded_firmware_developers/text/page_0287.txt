This appendix provides guidance on how to create the SPD data required for
motherboard designs that have the DDR3 SDRAM chips soldered directly
onto the motherboard. Modular DIMMs normally have an SPD EERPOM
that contains this information, which is used by the BIOS to correctly
configure the system during Memory Reference Code. Without this data, the
system will not boot; or at best it will try to boot with slow settings.

Since memory-down designs do not include DIMMs, they do not have
ready-made SPD data on an EEPROM for the BIOS to read, and the board
designer must assist BIOS or firmware developers to create the data. The data
can then be put into an onboard EEPROM off the SMBus (as a physical
DIMM would have), or the data can be hard-coded into the BIOS or placed

This appendix provides guidance on how to create the S P D data required for motherboard designs that have the D D R three S D Ram chips soldered directly onto the motherboard. Modular D I M Ms normally have an S P D E E P R O M that contains this information, which is used by the B I O S to correctly configure the system during Memory Reference Code. Without this data, the system will not boot; or at best it will try to boot with slow settings.

Since memory down designs do not include D I M Ms, they do not have ready made S P D data on an E E P R O M for the B I O S to read, and the board designer must assist B I O S or firmware developers to create the data. The data can then be put into an onboard E E P R O M off the S M B us (as a physical D I M M would have), or the data can be hard coded into the B I O S or placed
This appendix focuses on the generation of Serial Presence Detection, or S P D, data for down memory configurations. S P D is a crucial set of information stored on memory modules, typically within an E E P R O M chip, that allows the system's B I O S, or Basic Input Output System, to correctly identify and configure the installed memory. The appendix highlights that when a system fails to boot, or attempts to boot with suboptimal settings, it often stems from issues related to this S P D data.

The text explains that modular D I M Ms, or Dual In line Memory Modules, commonly found in desktop computers, usually incorporate an S P D E E P R O M chip containing this vital data. This information is read by the B I O S during the power on self test, or P O S T, phase to determine the memory's characteristics, such as its size, speed, and timings, enabling proper initialization and operation. Without accurate S P D data, the system's hardware cannot interface with the memory correctly, leading to boot failures or performance degradations.

The appendix then addresses scenarios where memory down designs, often encountered in embedded systems or specialized server configurations, might not include readily available S P D data. In such cases, the responsibility falls on the board designer and potentially B I O S or firmware developers to provide this information. The data can be programmed onto an on board E E P R O M, which is often connected via the S M B us, or System Management Bus, a two wire serial communication protocol. Alternatively, the memory configuration data can be hard coded directly into the B I O S or a similar firmware component. This ensures that the system can still correctly identify and utilize the memory even in the absence of a standard S P D E E P R O M. The underlying principle is that the system's firmware must have access to the memory's specifications to manage its operation, whether through a standardized interface like S P D or through direct configuration.
