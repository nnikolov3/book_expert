EITF SDRAM devices. Since the ECC data lines are not being used (not
shown, but they would have required the use of an additional x8 SDRAM
chip per channel), both DIMM equivalents are non-ECC.

Analyzing the schematics provides the SDRAM width and rank
information (SPD field #7). All the other information required in the SPD
data block will have to be extracted from the MT41J256M8HX-187-EITF

datasheet. This process is described in the next section.

Calculating Specific SPD Data Based on SDRAM
Datasheet

This section will go through each SPD field and explain how to extract the
data for the field out of the SDRAM datasheet. This section will use the
SDRAM configuration shown in Figure A.2, using the MT41J256M8HX-
187-EITF datasheet. Note that each section number will correspond to the
SPD field offset.

Each field will contain:
—The exact definition out of the JEDEC DDR3 specification.

—The appropriate section out of the MT41J256M8HX-187-EITF
datasheet
E I T F S D Ram devices. Since the E C C data lines are not being used (not shown, but they would have required the use of an additional X eight S D Ram chip per channel), both D I M M equivalents are non E C C. Analyzing the schematics provides the S D Ram width and rank information (S P D field number seven). All the other information required in the S P D data block will have to be extracted from the M T forty one J two fifty six M eight H X eighteen E I T F datasheet. This process is described in the next section.

This section will go through each S P D field and explain how to extract the data for the field out of the S D Ram datasheet. This section will use the S D Ram configuration shown in Figure A two, using the M T forty one J two fifty six M eight H X eighteen E I T F datasheet. Note that each section number will correspond to the S P D field offset.

Each field will contain:

The exact definition out of the J E D E C D D R three specification.

The appropriate section out of the M T forty one J two fifty six M eight H X eighteen E I T F datasheet.
The text discusses the practical aspects of configuring EITF S D Ram devices, specifically addressing scenarios where Error Correction Code, or E C C, data lines are not actively utilized. In such cases, a system would need to incorporate additional S D Ram chips, likely in an eight bit configuration per channel, to achieve the equivalent functionality of Dual In line Memory Modules, or D I M M s, that are non E C C. The analysis of schematics is crucial for determining the S D Ram width and rank information, which is a fundamental requirement for populating the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data block. Specifically, the text references S P D field number seven, and indicates that all other requisite information for the S P D data block will be sourced from the M T four one two five six M eight H X one eight seven E I T F datasheet, with the detailed process of extraction to be elaborated in a subsequent section.

The subsequent section is dedicated to the methodology for calculating specific S P D data by referencing the S D Ram datasheet. This involves a systematic examination of each individual S P D field. The approach outlined is to correlate information from the S D Ram configuration, as presented in a figure, with the corresponding data within the M T four one two five six M eight H X one eight seven E I T F datasheet. The intention is to extract precise data values for each S P D field, with the understanding that each section dedicated to a particular field will align with the specific offset within the S P D data structure. The content of each field's analysis will comprise two key components: firstly, the precise definition of the field according to the J E D E C D D R three specification, and secondly, the relevant section from the M T four one two five six M eight H X one eight seven E I T F datasheet that provides the necessary data for that field.
