The table details the encoding for Reference Raw Card Extension, Revision, and specific reference raw cards.

The first column, labeled "Bit 7", describes the "Reference Raw Card Extension". If Bit 7 is set to one, it indicates that reference raw cards AM through CB are used.

The second column, "Bits 6-5", defines the "Reference Raw Card Revision".
A value of "00" corresponds to revision 0.
A value of "01" corresponds to revision 1.
A value of "10" corresponds to revision 2.
A value of "11" corresponds to revision 3.

The third column, "Bits 4-0", specifies the "Reference Raw Card" when Bit 7 is equal to 1.

This document presents a bit-field decoding scheme, likely for hardware identification or configuration registers within a computer system. It breaks down an eight bit field into three distinct parts: Bit 7, Bits 6 through 5, and Bits 4 through 0, each serving a specific purpose in identifying or classifying components.

The first section, labeled "Bit 7," designates this bit as "Reference Raw Card Extension." The specific value "1" indicates "Reference raw cards AM through CB." This suggests that Bit 7 acts as a flag or an enable for a particular category or range of reference cards, potentially differentiating them from other types or revisions. The binary value of this bit determines whether this extension mechanism is active.

The second section, "Bits 6-5," is designated as "Reference Raw Card Revision." This two-bit field allows for the representation of multiple revision levels. The table shows that the binary pattern "00" corresponds to revision zero, "01" to revision one, "10" to revision two, and "11" to revision three. This is a standard encoding practice where a two-bit field can represent up to four distinct states, ideal for version management of hardware components. The number of possible states is two raised to the power of the number of bits, so two to the power of two equals four possible revisions.

The third and most detailed section concerns "Bits 4-0," labeled "Reference Raw Card." This five-bit field is used to specify individual reference raw cards. The table provides a mapping for values when Bit 7 is equal to one, indicating the extension is active. Here, the binary values from "00000" up to "11000" are explicitly mapped to specific reference cards, starting with "Reference raw card AM" and progressing through sequential alphanumeric identifiers like "AN," "AP," "AR," and so on, up to "Reference raw card BT." A five-bit field, with its two to the power of five, or thirty two possible states, allows for the identification of a significant number of unique items, in this case, reference cards. The table demonstrates a direct binary-to-identifier mapping, where each unique five-bit binary sequence translates to a particular reference card, enabling the system to precisely identify which specific reference card is being utilized or referenced. This level of granular identification is crucial in complex systems where many similar but distinct hardware components need to be managed and distinguished.
