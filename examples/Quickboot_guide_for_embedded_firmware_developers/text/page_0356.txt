The page presents information concerning Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or S D Ram, timing parameters and their representation within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure. Specifically, it details the mapping of S D Ram timing values into the S P D format, which is crucial for system initialization and configuration.

At the top, a table outlines various S D Ram timing parameters. Each entry includes a parameter name, a mnemonic code, minimum and maximum timing constraints, and the unit of measurement. For instance, "Write recovery time" has the mnemonic 'WR' and is defined with a minimum of fifteen nanoseconds and no specified maximum, with the unit being nanoseconds. "Delay from start of internal W R I T E transaction to internal R E A D command" uses the mnemonic 'WTR' and has a minimum constraint expressed as the greater of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds, with a maximum of not applicable, measured in clock cycles. Other parameters like R T P, C C D, D A L, and M R D are similarly defined, illustrating the precise timing relationships required for efficient S D Ram operation. These parameters govern critical operations such as data retrieval, precharging memory banks, and setting operational modes. The use of clock cycles (CK) indicates a dependency on the system clock frequency, while nanoseconds provide absolute time constraints.

The text then focuses on "S P D Field #27: Minimum Internal Read to Precharge Command Delay Time (t R T Pmin)", citing the Micron M T four one J two five six M eight Datasheet. This highlights how specific, performance-critical timing parameters are encoded within the S P D structure, allowing the system's memory controller to ascertain the capabilities and optimal operating settings of the installed S D Ram modules.

Subsequently, "S P D Field zero X one C: t F A W Upper Nibble" is introduced. This section explains that this particular S P D field relates to the t F A W, or Four Active Window, timing parameter in S D Ram. It specifies that this field, located at hexadecimal address one C, contains the "upper nibble" of the t F A W value. A table further clarifies this mapping: Byte twenty eight (decimal), which corresponds to hexadecimal one C, is designated as the field name "t F A W Upper Nibble" and has a typical value of zero X zero one. This entry is further elaborated upon: Byte twenty eight, specifically its upper nibble (bits seven through four), defines the most significant part of the t F A W timing value. The lower nibble (bits three through zero) is reserved and references Byte twenty nine for its definition. This structure indicates a common practice in memory module configuration where a single byte is split to encode multiple related pieces of information or to accommodate values that require more than four bits but less than a full byte. The value of t F A W itself is derived from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet, underscoring the interrelation between S P D definitions and the underlying memory device specifications. This level of detail in S P D data is essential for automated system configuration, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance across diverse hardware configurations.
