Fast Boot eliminates most possibilities of system resets.

Intel Architecture Coding Efficiency

Intel architecture performance can be sensitive to coding arrangement
(just like any other computer architecture). Follow coding optimization guide
at the Intel Software portal is the best-known method. At a minimum, code
and data structure alignments should be optimized as described in the
optimization guide. (See also EDK II Performance Optimization Guide â€”
Section 8.10.)

Network Boot Feature

A network boot (booting to an OS image over LAN) takes several seconds to
negotiate with the DHCP server for an IP address. Fast Boot is not really an

option.

Value-Add, But Complex Features

Complexity and robust feature sets will likely result in a flexible, but slower
boot performance than a simple configuration. RAID is a feature that adds a
lot of value, but can decrease the speed of the boot due to an option ROM
execution requirement. Here UEFI drivers can help with some of the boot

speeds, but cannot completely compensate for the tradeoffs.

Network Boot Feature

A network boot, booting to an O S image over L A N, takes several seconds to negotiate with the D H C P server for an I P address. Fast Boot is not really an option.

Value Add, But Complex Features

Complexity and robust feature sets will likely result in a flexible, but slower boot performance than a simple configuration. R A I D is a feature that adds a lot of value, but can decrease the speed of the boot due to an option R O M execution requirement. Here U E F I drivers can help with some of the boot speeds, but cannot completely compensate for the tradeoffs.

Tools and the User Effect
The text discusses several aspects of computer system architecture and performance, focusing on boot optimization and feature sets.

Regarding "Intel Architecture Coding Efficiency," it highlights that processor performance, particularly on Intel architectures, is sensitive to how code is arranged and optimized. This sensitivity stems from the underlying instruction set architecture, pipeline design, and cache hierarchies. Following coding optimization guides, such as those provided by Intel software, is crucial for achieving peak performance. These guides often detail techniques like instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, vectorization (using S I M D instructions), and memory access pattern optimization. The mention of "code and data structure alignments" points to the importance of ensuring that data resides in memory in a way that aligns with processor word sizes or cache line boundaries. Misaligned data access can lead to multiple memory accesses, increased latency, and performance penalties because the processor may need to perform additional operations to fetch or construct the required data from different memory locations. Section eight point ten of the E D K two Performance Optimization Guide is referenced, indicating a specific set of recommendations for system firmware and embedded systems development within the Intel ecosystem.

The "Network Boot Feature" section describes the process of booting an operating system over a local area network, commonly known as network booting or PX E booting. This involves the target system acquiring an IP address from a D H C P server and then fetching the operating system image from a network server. The statement that "Fast Boot is not really an option" in this context implies that network booting inherently involves communication overhead and data transfer delays that are typically greater than local storage boot times, thus making it less compatible with aggressive boot time optimizations. The negotiation with a D H C P server for an IP address is a fundamental networking protocol that establishes communication parameters.

The "Value Add, But Complex Features" subsection addresses the trade-offs associated with implementing feature-rich systems. It notes that complexity, while offering flexibility and enhanced functionality, can negatively impact performance, particularly boot speed. R A I D (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is cited as an example of a feature that adds significant value by improving data redundancy and I O performance but can also increase boot time due to the need for initialization and configuration of multiple disk drives. The text suggests that U E F I drivers, as part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, can mitigate some of the boot speed degradation associated with such features by offering more efficient hardware initialization and driver loading mechanisms compared to traditional BIOS systems. However, they cannot fully eliminate the overhead introduced by complex configurations.

Finally, "Tools and the User Effect" implies that the tools used for system development and configuration, as well as the choices made by users, can influence the overall system performance and user experience. This could refer to diagnostic tools, performance profiling tools, or even the way system parameters are set by the end user.
