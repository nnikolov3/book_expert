A Type 1 Exception can be completely handled within an EFI module and the
remainder of the BIOS boot flow will continue with the BOOT _ WITH_
MINIMAL_CONFIGURATION flag. Optionally, the exception can be logged
for diagnostic purposes.

A Type 2 Exception occurs if a BIOS module encounters an issue that
will prevent the rest of the BIOS from continuing the Fast Boot framework.

The remainder of the boot sequence may execute slower than anticipated but

Table 11.2: Types of Exceptions

The table shows exception types and their associated boot flows. Type One has a Fast Boot flow and does not require a reset, leading to a Fast Boot next boot flow. Type Two also has a Fast Boot flow, and it does not require a reset, resulting in a Fast Boot next boot flow, with the exception description noting it proceeds until the remainder of the boot sequence is a Full Boot. Type Three and Type Four both have N A for their current boot flow and require a reset, with Type Three leading to a Full Boot with Fast M R C next boot flow, and Type Four leading to a Full Boot with Full M R C training next boot flow.

A Type One exception can be completely handled within an E F I module and the remainder of the B I O S boot flow will continue with the B O O T underscore W I T H underscore M I N I M A L underscore C O N F I G U R A T I O N flag. Optionally, the exception can be logged for diagnostic purposes.

A Type Two exception occurs if a B I O S module encounters an issue that will prevent the rest of the B I O S from continuing the Fast Boot framework. The remainder of the boot sequence may execute slower than anticipated but
The discussion centers on system exceptions that can influence the boot process, categorizing them by their impact on the boot flow and whether a system reset is required. These exceptions can stem from hardware changes, such as those involving the C P U, memory, display, input devices, boot target, or the real time clock battery. BIOS setting modifications are also identified as a trigger for events, potentially affecting the boot target and console input output operations. Furthermore, software changes, specifically U E F I updates, are cited as another source of exceptions.

The text clarifies that not all exceptions necessitate a complete reboot of the system; some might interrupt the current boot sequence and resolve on the subsequent boot cycle. Table 11 dot 2 enumerates various exception types, detailing their current boot flow behavior, whether a reset is required, and the subsequent boot flow.

Examining Table 11 dot 2:

*   **Type 1 Exception:** Characterized by a "Fast Boot" current boot flow and does not require a reset. The next boot flow also remains "Fast Boot." This suggests a non-disruptive exception that is handled without altering the accelerated boot procedure.

*   **Type 2 Exception:** Presents a "Fast Boot up until Exception, remainder of boot sequence is Full Boot" current boot flow, and similarly does not require a reset. The next boot flow continues as "Fast Boot." This indicates an exception that occurs partway through a fast boot, after which the system reverts to a standard full boot for the remainder of the current sequence, yet maintains fast boot capabilities for subsequent operations.

*   **Type 3 Exception:** Labeled as "N A" for its current boot flow, this exception *requires* a reset. The subsequent boot flow is described as "Full Boot with Fast M R C." M R C likely refers to Memory Reference Code, implying that a more thorough memory initialization process is engaged after the reset.

*   **Type 4 Exception:** Also designated "N A" for its current boot flow, this exception *requires* a reset. The next boot flow is "Full Boot with Full M R C training." This signifies a more comprehensive boot process than Type 3, involving complete memory retraining, which might be necessary for unstable or newly configured memory modules.

The text further elaborates on Type 1 and Type 2 exceptions. A Type 1 exception is completely manageable within an E F I module. The subsequent boot process proceeds unimpeded, with the option to log the exception for diagnostic purposes if a specific flag, such as B O O T underscore W I T H underscore M I N I M A L underscore C O N F I G U R A T I O N, is set. Type 2 exceptions arise when a BIOS module encounters an issue that interferes with the fast boot framework. While the fast boot may be interrupted, the system eventually recovers, although the remainder of the boot sequence might take longer than initially anticipated. This implies a trade-off between boot speed and the robustness of the fast boot mechanism when certain exceptions occur.
