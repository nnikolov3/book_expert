which implies the width (D dimension) of the module. Other module physical
characteristics, such as height (A dimension) or thickness (E dimension) are
documented in the module-specific section of the SPD. Refer to the relevant

The text describes the function of specific bytes within a memory module's serial presence detect, or S P D, data structure, particularly focusing on identifying the memory module type and its physical dimensions. Byte three, specifically, encodes the S D Ram module type, and its interpretation is based on the value of bits three through zero.

This byte's bit field is divided into two parts: bits seven through four, designated as reserved, and bits three through zero, which represent the module type. The following table illustrates the mapping of these four bits to various S D Ram module types, along with their specified nominal widths. For instance, a binary value of zero zero zero zero, or hexadecimal zero, in bits three through zero indicates an undefined module type. A value of zero zero zero one, hexadecimal one, signifies an R D I M M, a Registered Dual In line Memory Module, with a nominal width of one hundred thirty three point three five millimeters. Similarly, zero zero one zero, hexadecimal two, denotes a U D I M M, an Unbuffered Dual In line Memory Module, also with a nominal width of one hundred thirty three point three five millimeters.

The table further defines S O D I M M, Small Outline Dual In line Memory Module, with a width of sixty seven point six millimeters, and Micro D I M M, Micro Dual In line Memory Module, whose width is marked as to be determined. It also categorizes various "mini" form factors: Mini R D I M M, Mini U D I M M, and Mini C D I M M, all with specified nominal widths. Additionally, it includes entries for 72 bit S O U D I M M, 72 bit S O R D I M M, and 72 bit S O C D I M M, all with a nominal width of sixty seven point six millimeters, along with L R D I M M, Load Reduction Dual In line Memory Module, at one hundred thirty three point three five millimeters, and 16 bit S O D I M M and 32 bit S O D I M M, both at sixty seven point six millimeters. Values not explicitly listed are reserved.

The text also provides definitions for the acronyms used, clarifying that R D I M M stands for Registered Dual In line Memory Module, L R D I M M for Load Reduction Dual In line Memory Module, U D I M M for Unbuffered Dual In line Memory Module, S O D I M M for Unbuffered 64 bit Small Outline Dual In line Memory Module, Micro D I M M for Micro Dual In line Memory Module, Mini R D I M M for Mini Registered Dual In line Memory Module, and Mini U D I M M for Mini Unbuffered Dual In line Memory Module. These definitions are crucial for understanding the operational characteristics and physical attributes of different memory module form factors. The physical characteristics like width, represented by the D dimension, and height or thickness, represented by the A and E dimensions respectively, are documented in the module specific section of the S P D and are further detailed in the relevant JEDEC JC 11 module outline documents. This standardized approach ensures interoperability and allows system firmware to correctly identify and configure installed memory modules.
