The concept of a zero-second boot refers to an idealized state where an operating system becomes immediately responsive upon system power-on. However, achieving this is contingent upon the time taken by the initial boot firmware, such as the Basic Input Output System or B I O S, to initialize hardware and load the operating system. If the operating system's own boot process, which includes device enumeration and driver loading, exceeds a certain threshold, the perceived benefit of firmware improvements aimed at faster booting can be negated. A reasonable amount of B I O S improvement is going to be lost anyway, even a zero-second boot is too long if the O S takes more than ten seconds to boot.The operating system often repeats enumeration of buses in the post-boot space that the B I O S firmware has performed in the pre-boot. Ideally, this would be a source of timing savings. However, upon further inspection, there are multiple reasons for this replication, including but not limited to the following: the firmware may not have done a complete job of enumerating the entire enumerable subsystem, expecting software to repeat the enumeration when the O S level drivers load; virtualization, where the firmware can perform a full enumeration of a bus, then expose a different set or a subset of hardware to the operating system through virtualization technology; the firmware may not have done an accurate job; and the initial enumeration may not work well with the kernel or device driver stack designed by the operating system developers.At the end of the day, the B I O S must enumerate the portions of the design only just enough to boot the operating system. Assuming the operating system has the proper enumeration support for the system hardware, the enumeration will be repeated and in a more complete manner than in the B I O S. Standard enumerable bus architecture allows for this replication, and the system may require it. Examples include P C I and U S B enumeration. The whole U S B network under a port may not need to be enumerated five-plus hubs deep. The B I O S really needs to initialize all the hardware that cannot be enumerated through industry standards, such as i two C.Other factors affecting boot speed include certain devices or configurations that are known to extend boot times. No duplication in hardware enumeration within U E F I is recommended. While replication of enumeration may be required between B I O S and O S, it is not required within the U E F I domain itself. If necessary, the B I O S can pass information between modules via U E F I variables or H O B s. Minimizing occurrences of hardware resets is also crucial, as most hardware have a long power reset sequence. Questioning whether a hardware reset is necessary, or if it can be handled in software without reinitializing hardware, presents an opportunity for significant boot time improvements.Fast Boot eliminates most possibilities of system resets. Intel architecture performance can be sensitive to coding arrangement, just like any other computer architecture. Following coding optimization guides, such as those provided by Intel software, is crucial for achieving peak performance. At a minimum, code and data structure alignments should be optimized as described in the optimization guide. Network boot, booting to an O S image over L A N, takes several seconds to negotiate with the D H C P server for an I P address, making Fast Boot not a viable option. Complexity and robust feature sets, such as R A I D, can add value but decrease boot speed due to option R O M execution requirements. U E F I drivers can help with some boot speeds, but cannot completely compensate for the tradeoffs. Ultimately, optimizing boot performance requires a balanced approach, considering factors such as hardware enumeration, coding efficiency, and feature sets to achieve the fastest possible boot times while maintaining system functionality and responsiveness.
