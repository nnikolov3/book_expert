The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I, environment provides a robust framework for executing applications, including shell applications. A key aspect of U E F I is its ability to utilize various protocols, such as Unicode Collation, and potentially others like Simple File System or Block I O, if they are present. To ensure compatibility, it is essential to consult the documentation for each U E F I application to determine the required protocols.The E F I Shell, a nonstandard shell, has no predefined behavior for commands and no set of commands that must be present. However, due to the dominance of a single implementation in the marketplace, a de facto standard has emerged. The E F I Shell offers standard features, but its binary size can be customized, allowing for fine-tuning. In contrast, the U E F I Shell two point zero, a standards-based version, incorporates all commands from its predecessor and introduces new ones. Script files written for the E F I Shell can typically operate on the U E F I Shell, but the reverse is not always true.Two significant changes in the U E F I Shell affect script files. The first is the concept of levels and profiles for the shell, which enables querying for command availability before execution. This is crucial for tasks like driver diagnostics, where a command like Get Mtc is used to obtain a monotonic tick count. The second change is the introduction of Standard Format Output, or -sfo, a feature that allows for parameterized output formats. By specifying -sfo, the output is presented in a specific format, making it easier to parse and redirect to a file.U E F I Shell applications are executable programs that run within the U E F I environment. They are loaded into memory, invoked via an entry point function, and unloaded after execution. These applications depend on elements provided by U E F I, which can be accessed via the System Table through Boot Services or Runtime Services. A well-designed application will have clear documentation or user messages indicating its dependencies.What distinguishes a shell application is that it must run after the shell application itself has started. This provides benefits such as parameters, file system, and environment. When a U E F I application starts, it receives parameters as a single long array of C H A R sixteen, requiring the application to parse and determine associations between parameters. In contrast, a U E F I Shell application is passed Argc and Argv, similar to a standard C application, allowing for smaller, faster, and easier-to-maintain applications.The file system in the U E F I environment is accessed via Device Paths, which can be challenging for humans to read and write. For example, the Device Path for a U S B hard disk is Pci Root open parenthesis zero x zero close parenthesis slash Pci open parenthesis zero x one D comma zero x three close parenthesis slash U S B open parenthesis zero x one comma zero x zero close parenthesis. The shell creates human-readable map names, such as F S zero, and consistent map names, like f seventeen b zero, making it easier to use. However, a U E F I application must interpret the full device path and find the required file, which can be a compound problem due to multiple file systems.In summary, the U E F I environment provides a robust framework for executing applications, including shell applications. Understanding the differences between E F I and U E F I Shells, as well as the benefits and challenges of shell applications, is essential for developing effective and compatible applications. By leveraging the features and services provided by U E F I, developers can create smaller, faster, and easier-to-maintain applications that can operate seamlessly within the U E F I environment.
