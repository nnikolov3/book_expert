The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, or A C P I, is a comprehensive industry standard designed to centralize and enhance system configuration and power management. In accordance with the following specifications: the Enhanced Disk Drive Specification, version three point zero, revision zero point eight, the B I O S Boot Specification, version one point zero one, the P C I B I O S Specification, version two point one, the P O S T Memory Manager Specification, version one point zero one, the Plug and Play B I O S Specification, version one point zero A, and the S A T A A H C I Revision one point one specification, A C P I provides a unified method for describing platform capabilities to the operating system.A C P I consists of tables and namespace, which collectively provide a detailed abstract model of the platform's hardware, including its power states, thermal zones, and device capabilities. The Root System Description Pointer, or R S D P, is the main A C P I table that points to all the other tables. It is located either at hexadecimal E zero zero zero zero to F F F F F in legacy B I O S or can be located elsewhere as specified in the U E F I system table.The System Description Table Header is a common structure that is at the top of every table, except F A C S. The Root System Description Table, or R S D T, is a thirty two bit table that is becoming obsolete and may no longer be used in modern systems. However, it can still be used to point to many of the other tables. The Extended System Description Table, or X S D T, replaces R S D T and supports both thirty two bit and sixty four bit systems. It points to all other tables and is the standard mechanism for operating systems to discover and access A C P I tables in modern systems.The Fixed A C P I Description Table, or F A D T, provides fixed addresses for key A C P I hardware registers, including the G P E block, P M block, and A C P I Timer. It also provides I O port details to access or enable S M I ports and contains the specific port address and value combination necessary to trigger a system reset. The F A D T points to other essential tables, namely the D S D T and F A C S tables.The Firmware A C P I Control Structure, or F A C S, includes the hardware signature, waking vector of the thirty two bit real mode, and sixty four bit physical address resume vectors and global lock support. The Differentiated System Description Table, or D S D T, is the main table for A M L, or A C P I Machine Language, code, which is a byte code interpreted by the operating system's A C P I driver to control various hardware components.In addition to these core tables, there are several other tables that provide additional information to the operating system. The Secondary System Description Table, or S S D T, is a modular extension to the D S D T, supporting diverse hardware configurations and enabling system adaptability. The Multiple Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller Description Table, or M A D T, describes the system's interrupt topology, including I O x A P I Cs and Local C P U A P I Cs. The Smart Battery Table, or S B S T, is an O E M specific table depending on the battery mated to the system.The Embedded Controller Boot Resources Table, or E C D T, optionally describes resources used by the embedded controller, providing earlier access to the E C than if the system has to wait until the O S loads the E C drivers later in the boot. The Boot Graphics Resource Table, or B G R T, describes the location of the board splash screen for the O S to load during O S boot, providing a seamless boot experience between the B I O S and the O S. The Firmware Performance Data Table, or F P D T, describes pre O S firmware execution time to the O S or tools without the need for a wall clock or stopwatch.There are also many server and N U M A system tables that provide the operating system with enhanced details of the capabilities of dual and multi socketed systems. These tables include the System Locality Distance Information, which helps the O S to optimize memory access and reduce latency. By providing a comprehensive and standardized interface for the operating system to discover and manage system hardware, A C P I enables efficient power management, robust configuration, and responsive interaction with the platform's diverse components, ultimately contributing to improved system performance, reliability, and user experience.
