The P C I I R Q Routing Table is a crucial data structure that provides essential configuration information to the operating system regarding P C I interrupt routing. This table defines the mapping and control mechanisms for interrupt requests generated by P C I devices, enabling proper system functionality and interoperability. The table commences with a signature, expressed as the A S C I I string "dollar P I R", which serves as a unique identifier for the data structure. The signature is followed by a version field, which consists of a minor version byte and a major version byte, allowing for backward compatibility and future extensibility of the table format.The table size field holds the size of the P C I I R Q Routing Table in bytes, informing the system how much memory to allocate or scan for the entire table. The P C I Interrupt Router's Bus and Dev Func fields identify the specific P C I bus segment and device responsible for managing interrupts. The P C I Exclusive I R Qs field is a sixteen-bit bitmap that indicates which I R Qs are devoted exclusively to P C I usage, preventing conflicts between different bus architectures. The Compatible P C I Interrupt Router field contains the Vendor I D and Device I D of a compatible P C I Interrupt Router, allowing the operating system to dynamically adapt to different chipsets and their interrupt controllers.The Miniport Data field is a parameter passed directly to the I R Q Miniport's Initialize function, providing additional initialization information for the miniport driver. The Reserved field is set to zero, providing flexibility for future revisions of the specification. Finally, the Checksum field ensures data integrity for the entire P C I I R Q Routing Table, preventing the operating system from attempting to configure hardware with invalid interrupt routing information.Each slot entry in the table is sixteen bytes long and describes how a slot's P C I interrupt pins are wire O R'd to other slot interrupt pins and to the chipset's I R Q pins. The "wire O R'd" connection scheme allows multiple devices or slots to share an interrupt line, asserting an interrupt request if any of the connected devices trigger an event. Figure five point one presents an illustrative example of such a dollar sign P I R table, detailing various P C I device interrupt configurations and providing a mapping for P C I devices and their interrupt pins.However, modern operating systems have evolved to employ more sophisticated and extensible frameworks, such as the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, or A C P I. A C P I defines a set of tables and interfaces that allow the operating system to discover and manage system resources in a more programmatic and less B I O S-dependent manner. The Fixed A C P I Description Table, or F A D T, specifies fundamental system characteristics, including details pertinent to interrupt routing, and can indicate which specific methods the system employs for P C I I R Q mapping.In multiprocessor systems, the interrupt routing to I O X A P I C s is now described in the A C P I namespace using A S L, allowing the O S to dynamically configure interrupt pathways and ensuring efficient and correct interrupt delivery in complex, heterogeneous computing environments. The P C I Express Specification and the P C I Firmware Specification have become supersets of previous P C I local bus specification and P C I B I O S specifications, providing backward compatibility and a more comprehensive approach to system configuration and power management.P C I E A S P M, or Active State Power Management, defines three key specifications, including the P C I Express Base Specification, the P C I Local Bus Specification, and the P C I to P C I Bridge Architecture Specification. These specifications provide a framework for managing power consumption in P C I Express devices, enabling systems to conserve power and reduce energy consumption. Overall, the management of interrupt requests within P C I based systems using A C P I methods is a critical aspect of modern multiprocessor system architecture, requiring a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and specifications to ensure efficient and correct interrupt delivery.
