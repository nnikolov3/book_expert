The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure is a critical component in the configuration and operation of dynamic random access memory, or D Ram, modules. Within this structure, specific fields are designated to define the characteristics of the memory module, including its bus width and timing parameters. The Module Bus Width, defined in S P D Field zero x zero eight, is a key parameter that indicates the width of the S D Ram memory bus on the module. This field is set to zero x zero B, which corresponds to seventy two bits, if the design is implementing Error Correction Code, or E C C. Otherwise, it is set to zero x zero three, signifying thirty two bits.The table detailing the structure of this byte shows that bits two through zero encode the primary bus width, while bits four through three encode the bus extensions, such as parity or E C C. For instance, a value of binary zero zero zero within the primary bus width bits signifies zero bits, a value of binary zero zero one indicates eight bits, binary zero one zero represents thirty two bits, and binary zero one one denotes sixty four bits. The bus width extension is typically used for parity or E C C, with a value of binary zero zero zero indicating no extension.Examples illustrate how different combinations of bit fields in the S P D data allow for granular specification of memory module characteristics. A sixty four bit primary bus with no parity or E C C would be represented by a specific bit pattern, while a sixty four bit primary bus with an eight bit E C C would be encoded differently. These examples highlight the importance of precise specification of memory module characteristics for ensuring system compatibility and error detection.In addition to the Module Bus Width, the S P D data structure also defines timing parameters, such as the Fine Timebase Dividend/Divisor, specified in S P D Field zero x zero nine. This field is instrumental in calibrating memory timing parameters, particularly for Double Data Rate three, or D D R three, Random Access Memory, or Ram, modules. The primary function of this field is to establish a fundamental timebase, expressed in picoseconds, which serves as a multiplier for calculating more granular timing specifications.The Fine Timebase Dividend and Divisor are defined within the most and least significant nibbles of the byte, respectively. The actual fundamental timebase is derived by dividing the dividend by the divisor. For example, a common configuration is to use the hexadecimal value zero x fifty two for this field, resulting in a fundamental timebase of two point five picoseconds. This two point five picosecond granularity is crucial for achieving precise timing in high speed memory interfaces.The Medium Timebase Dividend/Divisor, specified in S P D Fields zero x zero A and zero x zero B, is another critical parameter that defines a value in nanoseconds representing the fundamental timebase for medium grain timing calculations. This value is typically the greatest common divisor for the range of clock frequencies supported by a particular S D Ram. The Medium Timebase Dividend and Divisor are used to establish a reference point for calculating memory timings, allowing for a more flexible and granular representation of timing parameters.The utilization of these bytes within the S P D data structure is essential for defining the timing characteristics of the memory. The system's basic input output system, or B I O S, accesses the S P D data during the initialization phase to configure the memory controller. The M T B value, expressed in nanoseconds, represents a reference point for calculating memory timings, which are crucial for ensuring stable and efficient memory operation. The M T B is used as a multiplier or divisor in conjunction with other timing values to derive specific delays and pulse widths required by the memory interface. By understanding the structure and significance of these S P D fields, developers can optimize memory configuration and operation, leading to improved system performance and reliability.
