The document details aspects of DDR3 Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D D R three S D Ram, focusing on its density and addressing scheme as defined by the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard. A primary concept is the relationship between a memory module's capacity and its underlying structure, specifically the number of rows, columns, and memory banks. The document highlights that memory density is not always explicitly stated but can be derived from these structural parameters.The first section presents a simplified model for calculating memory capacity, expressed as Density, or Capacity, is equal to two raised to the power of the sum of row bits, column bits, and bank bits, multiplied by the D R A M width. This formula encapsulates the fundamental principles of addressable memory space within a semiconductor memory device. Each component—rows, columns, and banks—contributes to the total number of unique addresses, and the width of each data transfer, or the D R A M width, determines how much data is retrieved per access.The S P D Field number four, "S D Ram Density and Banks" Example from Micron, illustrates how this information is typically extracted directly from the S D Ram datasheet. Often, the bank bits are specified instead of the number of banks, that is, three bank bits would provide eight banks, total. Likewise, in the odd situation where the D Ram density, or capacity, is not obviously spelled out in the datasheet, it can be calculated by multiplying the full address range by the D Ram width.The table labeled "S P D Field zero times zero five: S D R A M Rows and Columns" provides specific encoding for memory configurations. Byte index five, represented numerically as five and hexadecimal zero x zero five, defines parameters for S D R A M addressing. The "Field Name" column indicates "S D R A M Rows and Columns," and the "Typ. Value" is hexadecimal zero x one nine. The "Definition" column clarifies that this value translates to fifteen rows and ten columns. This implies that the bits within S P D byte five are used to encode the number of rows and columns, which are critical for the memory controller to correctly address data.The S D Ram device's command structure is also detailed, where bits two to zero encode the number of column address bits, and bits five to three encode the number of row address bits. These values come from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet. The binary patterns corresponding to specific numbers of address bits are also provided, with zero zero zero mapping to twelve row address bits, and this pattern continues, with zero zero one corresponding to thirteen, zero one zero to fourteen, zero one one to fifteen, and one zero zero to sixteen row address bits. Any other combinations are reserved.The table titled "Table two Addressing" further elucidates the addressing schemes for different S D Ram configurations, such as five hundred twelve megabytes by four times eight banks, two hundred fifty six megabytes by eight times eight banks, and one hundred twenty eight megabytes by sixteen times eight banks. The parameter is Configuration, with refresh counts and row, bank, and column addressing specified for each configuration. For instance, the five hundred twelve megabytes by four configuration uses thirty two K row addresses, represented by address bits A fourteen to zero, and two K column addresses, represented by address bits A eleven to zero.The section "S P D Field number five: 'S D Ram Rows and Columns' Example from Micron" provides a practical instance of how this information is consumed. It clarifies that the row and column values are derived from the signals that are active when the Row Address Strobe, or R A S, and Column Address Strobe, or C A S, signals are strobed, respectively. The S P D data is directly extracted from the specific S D Ram datasheet. In this particular example, A nine to zero represents ten individual address lines, which are used for both column and row fields in the S P D data.Additionally, the document discusses S P D Field hex zero six: Nominal Voltage, V D D, which describes the Voltage Level for D Ram and other components on the module. The table shows information about this specific S P D field, with a typical value of one point five volts. The "Operable" voltage is defined as the V D D voltage at which module operation is allowed using the performance values programmed in the S P D, while the "Endurant" voltage is defined as the V D D voltage at which the module may be powered without adversely affecting the life expectancy or reliability. Further specifications will exist to define the amount of time that the "Endurant" voltage can be applied to the module, with operation not supported at this voltage.In conclusion, the provided text offers a comprehensive overview of the addressing schemes and configuration parameters for DDR3 SDRAM, as defined by the Serial Presence Detect standard. The relationship between memory capacity, rows, columns, and banks is highlighted, along with the calculation of memory density from these structural parameters. The encoding of memory configurations, row and column addressing, and nominal voltage levels are also detailed, providing a thorough understanding of the underlying principles of SDRAM operation and configuration.
