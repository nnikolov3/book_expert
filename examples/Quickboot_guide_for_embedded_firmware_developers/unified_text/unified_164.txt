The provided text details specific timing parameters for Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) modules. The information is derived from the JEDEC DDR3 SPD specification, focusing on the minimum RAS to CAS delay time, denoted as tRCDmin. This parameter is crucial for the efficient operation of memory systems, dictating the minimum time required between activating a row in the memory array and issuing a column read or write command.The tables presented show key timing parameters for different speed grades of DDR3 memory, including their data rates and target timing values for tRCD, tRP, and CL. The data rates are measured in Mega Transfers per second (MT/s), and the timing parameters are expressed in nanoseconds (ns). For instance, the -125 speed grade operates at sixteen hundred MT/s, with target tRCD-tRP-CL values of eleven-eleven-eleven, resulting in actual timings of thirteen point seven five ns for tRCD, tRP, and CL.The notes provide important context regarding backward compatibility, stating that certain speed grades are compatible with lower speeds, such as the -187E speed grade being backward compatible to one thousand sixty six MT/s with a CL of seven. Understanding these timing parameters is fundamental to memory system design, enabling precise control over data access and ensuring optimal performance and stability.Additionally, the document references SPD Field 0x13, which pertains to the minimum Row Active to Row Active Delay time, represented as tRRDmin. This timing parameter is critical for managing concurrent operations within the memory array, defining the minimum interval between activating two different rows. The example provided, taken from the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet, underscores the practical application of these specifications in real-world memory components.The calculation of tRRDmin involves extracting the value from the datasheet and dividing it by the Medium Timebase Divisor. In the example, the tRRD value is seven point five ns, and the Medium Timebase Divisor is zero point one two five ns, resulting in a tRRDmin value of sixty, which is hexadecimal 3C. This value is defined in Byte 19 of the SPD, which specifies the minimum SDRAM Row Active to Row Active Delay Time in Medium Timebase units.Controller designers must note that at some frequencies, a minimum number of clocks may be required, resulting in a larger tRRDmin value than indicated in the SPD. For example, tRRDmin for DDR3-800 must be four clocks. The value of tRRDmin may also be dependent on the SDRAM page size, which can be determined by referring to the DDR3 SDRAM datasheet section on Addressing.In summary, the provided text details the importance of timing parameters in DDR3 SDRAM modules, including tRCDmin and tRRDmin, and provides examples of how these values are calculated and applied in real-world memory components. Understanding these parameters is crucial for designing efficient and stable memory systems. The performance analysis reveals that the tRCD values range from ten point two eight five ns to fifteen ns, depending on the speed grade and configuration. The tRCD offset values also vary, with some configurations having an offset of zero, while others have negative offsets, such as minus fifty or minus ninety. The FTB values remain constant at zero point zero zero one ns. The resultant tRCD values are calculated based on these inputs, demonstrating a direct relationship between the MTB units and the resulting tRCD.The data presented in the tables shows a correlation between the speed grades, data rates, and timing parameters. The speed grades, such as -125, -125E, -153, and -187, have corresponding data rates and target timing values. The actual timing values, including tRCD, tRP, and CL, are also provided, allowing for a detailed analysis of the memory module's performance characteristics.The use of hexadecimal values, such as 0x64, 0x69, and 0x78, represents the tRCD offset values in FTB units. The conversion of these values to decimal form, such as zero, thirty-five, and ninety, facilitates a clearer understanding of the timing parameters. The calculation of the resultant tRCD values, taking into account the MTB units, MTB ns, tRCD offset, and FTB ns, demonstrates the complexity of the timing parameters involved in DDR3 SDRAM modules.The provided information serves as a foundation for understanding the intricacies of DDR3 SDRAM timing parameters, enabling the design of efficient and stable memory systems. The data presented in the tables, along with the explanations and examples, offers a comprehensive overview of the subject matter, making it an invaluable resource for individuals involved in the design and development of memory systems. The tables presented here detail timing parameters for Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) modules, specifically focusing on the tRCD (RAS to CAS Delay) parameter and its relationship with various other timing specifications and operational uses. Each row represents a specific configuration or performance characteristic, correlating tRCD, measured in cycles (MTB units), with its equivalent in nanoseconds (MTB ns), an offset value, a Fixed Clock Frequency (FTB) in nanoseconds, and a resultant tRCD in nanoseconds, ultimately categorized by its intended use, often relating to memory speed grades.The first table exhibits entries where the tRCD Offset (FTB units) is consistently zero. The MTB units column provides values ranging from eighty to one hundred twenty. Correspondingly, the MTB ns column shows a uniform value of zero point one two five nanoseconds, indicating a fixed base timing interval. The FTB ns column remains at zero point zero zero one nanoseconds across these entries. The resultant tRCD in nanoseconds is calculated based on these inputs, suggesting a direct proportionality between the MTB units and the resulting tRCD. For instance, an MTB unit value of one hundred yields a tRCD result of twelve point five nanoseconds, while one hundred twenty units result in fifteen nanoseconds. This section maps these timing characteristics to various DDR3 speed bins, such as DDR3-800D, DDR3-1066E, DDR3-1066F, DDR3-1066G, DDR3-1333F, DDR3-1333G, DDR3-1333H, DDR3-1333H downbin, DDR3-1333J, DDR3-1600G, DDR3-1600H, DDR3-1600J, and DDR3-1600K. The "downbin" designation typically implies a component that meets a lower speed grade than its initial specification, potentially due to manufacturing tolerances. The subsequent rows in the first table introduce a tRCD Offset. For example, a tRCD offset of minus fifty units, represented as hexadecimal zero times C E, with an MTB of eighty six units and zero point one two five MTB ns, results in a tRCD of ten point seven nanoseconds, associated with DDR3-1866J. Similarly, an offset of minus one hundred five units, hexadecimal zero times ninety seven, with ninety five MTB units and zero point one two five MTB ns, yields an eleven point seven nanosecond tRCD for DDR3-1866K. These offsets demonstrate how adjustments to the base tRCD can fine-tune performance for higher speed grades. The second table presents a similar structure but focuses on different timing offsets and DDR3 speed grades. Here, tRCD offsets include minus thirty five, minus ninety, and zero units. The MTB units range from eighty three to one hundred five, with MTB ns consistently at zero point one two five. The FTB ns remains at zero point zero zero one nanoseconds. The calculated tRCD results vary, with an offset of minus thirty five units (hexadecimal zero times D D) and one hundred three MTB units yielding twelve point eight four nanoseconds for DDR3-1866L. An offset of minus ninety units (hexadecimal zero times A six) with one hundred twelve MTB units results in thirteen point nine one nanoseconds for DDR3-1866M, and a zero offset with one hundred five MTB units produces thirteen point one two five nanoseconds, specified as DDR3-1866M downbin. Further entries show an offset of minus ninety five units (hexadecimal zero times A one) with ninety eight MTB units leading to twelve point one five nanoseconds for DDR3-2133M, and an offset of minus thirty five units (hexadecimal zero times D D) with one hundred five MTB units resulting in thirteen point zero nine nanoseconds for DDR3-2133N. These data points illustrate the critical role of precise tRCD tuning, influenced by offsets, to achieve the performance targets for increasingly higher frequency DDR memory standards. The underlying principle is that tRCD, a fundamental latency in memory access, needs to be carefully managed to synchronize operations between the memory row address strobe (RAS) and column address strobe (CAS) signals, ensuring data integrity and maximizing throughput. The variations in tRCD, influenced by these offsets and base timings, are essential for meeting the stringent timing requirements of successive generations of memory technology.
