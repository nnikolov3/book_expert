The discussion revolves around advanced configuration options, particularly focusing on overclocking and the fundamental process of Peripheral Connect Interface or P C I device enumeration. Regarding overclocking, several specialized configurations are detailed. The first is the ability to enable or disable clock output, a function typically determined by the system's enumeration process, which is the mechanism for identifying and initializing hardware components. Secondly, clock spread settings can be adjusted; this involves modifying the clock signal's timing characteristics to reduce electromagnetic interference and potentially improve signal integrity, though the specific adjustments are provided as fixed register values derived from anticipated usage scenarios. A crucial feature for performance tuning is the option to underclock the C P U for adaptive clocking support. When this underclocking is performed directly, it necessitates that the Basic Input Output System or B I O S implements a ramp algorithm. This algorithm gradually adjusts the clock frequency, preventing abrupt changes that could lead to instability or operational errors. Finally, the system allows for locking out clock registers prior to transitioning to the host O S. This action prevents unauthorized or unintended modifications to the clock configuration by the operating system, ensuring that the B I O S managed settings are maintained.The subsequent section elaborates on P C I device enumeration. This process is defined as a generic term encompassing the detection and allocation of system resources to devices that adhere to the P C I standard. The discovery phase, integral to enumeration, is responsible for assigning the necessary resources to each detected device. These resources typically include memory, which can be utilized for input output or I O operations, and specifically prefetchable memory, which allows the system to read data from the device in anticipation of its use, enhancing performance. Another critical resource assignment involves memory mapped I O or M M I O space. This method maps device control registers and data buffers directly into the processor's memory address space, enabling the C P U to access them using standard memory load and store instructions. Additionally, interrupt request or I R Q assignments are managed, ensuring that devices can signal the C P U when they require attention. The enumeration process also covers the detection and execution of Expansion R O M, a read only memory chip that often contains firmware for initializing the P C I device and providing basic functionality before the main operating system drivers are loaded.The scope of P C I device discovery extends to a wide array of modern interfaces and controllers. This includes not only the legacy P C I Express or P C I E root ports, which are foundational for the P C I Express hierarchy, but also common peripherals like U S B controllers for universal serial bus devices, S A T A controllers for storage devices, audio controllers for sound hardware, and various add in cards or devices. The text highlights that this discovery mechanism is applicable to all newer, non legacy interfaces, underscoring the pervasive nature of the P C I enumeration standard in contemporary computer hardware. All these interfaces comply with the P C I specification, and for more detailed information, one can refer to the P C I Specification, with a list of applicable specifications found in the References section.It is also noted that in the U E F I system, the D X E phase does not execute the majority of drivers, but it is the B D S Phase that executes most of the required drivers in U E F I to allow the system to boot. Moving on to the initialization of graphics, if the platform has a head, then the video B I O S or Graphics Output Protocol U E F I driver is normally the first option R O M to be executed in the string. Once the main console out is up and running, the console in can be configured. For input devices, one should refer to the board schematics to determine which I O devices are in the system. Typically, a system will contain one or more of the following devices, including the Embedded Controller or E C, which is typically used in mobile or low power systems and contains separate firmware that controls the power management functions for the system, as well as P S two keyboard functionality.The Super I O or S I O chip is another component that controls the P S two, serial, and parallel interfaces. Most systems still support some of the legacy interfaces rather than implementing a legacy free system. Legacy free systems, on the other hand, use U S B as the input device, and if pre O S keyboard support is required, then the legacy keyboard interfaces must be trapped. The U S B controller supports both E H C I and X H C I, and to enable the host controller for standard P C I resources is relatively easy. However, if pre O S support for E H C I or X H C I is required, then the tasks associated with the U S B subsystem become substantially more complex. Legacy U S B requires an S M I handler to be used to trap port sixty four accesses to I O space and convert these to the proper keyboard or mouse commands, which is necessary for pre O S U S B support if booting to U S B is preferred.Lastly, the S A T A controller supports the A T A I D E programming interface, as well as the Advanced Host Controller Interface or A H C I, although A H C I is not available on all S K U s. The term A T A I D E Mode refers to the operation of the S A T A controller in a compatibility mode that mimics the behavior of legacy A T A or I D E devices, allowing for backward compatibility with older systems and devices. This compatibility is crucial for ensuring that newer systems can still interact with and support older hardware, which may not be compatible with the more advanced A H C I mode. The distinction between these modes highlights the evolving nature of storage interfaces and the need for systems to adapt to both new and legacy technologies seamlessly.
