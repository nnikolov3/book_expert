The minimum CAS Latency, or Column Address Strobe Latency, in Medium Timebase, or M T B, units is a critical parameter in synchronous dynamic random access memory, or S D Ram, modules. This value dictates the number of clock cycles required between the assertion of the C A S signal and the availability of the data. Software can leverage this information, in conjunction with the C A S Latencies supported, which are typically found in bytes fourteen and fifteen of the memory's serial presence detect, or S P D, data, to ascertain the optimal cycle time for a particular memory module. This value is derived from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet.The bits labeled seven through zero, or seven down to zero, specify the Minimum S D Ram C A S Latency Time, often denoted as t A A min, measured in M T B units. These values are defined to range from one to two hundred fifty-five. A critical aspect of this representation is the handling of non-integer divisions. If the t A A min value cannot be divided evenly by the M T B, the resulting value must be rounded up to the next larger integer. This rounded value, along with a Fine Offset, which is also stored in S P D byte thirty-five, is then used for correction to derive the actual, precise timing.An examination of the provided examples further elucidates this concept. For instance, when the t A A min in M T B units is one hundred, this corresponds to a hexadecimal value of zero x sixty four. The M T B value is zero point one two five nanoseconds. The t A A min Offset, measured in Fine Timebase, or F T B, units, is zero, and the F T B value itself is zero point zero zero one nanoseconds. This configuration results in a calculated t A A min Result of twelve point five nanoseconds, which is utilized for D D R three dash eight hundred D memory modules.The table displays timing parameters for D D R three memory modules, including t A A min in M T B units, M T B in nanoseconds, t A A min Offset in F T B units, F T B in nanoseconds, t A A min Result in nanoseconds, and Use. The Use column provides a designation for the D D R three memory, such as D D R three dash one zero six six F, D D R three dash one three three three G, or D D R three dash one eight six six M downbin. These designations are standard industry identifiers that indicate the memory's rated speed or bus frequency.The notes provide crucial context, including references to S P D byte thirty-five and the device datasheet for downbin support details. The text also specifies S P D Field number sixteen, which is defined as Minimum C A S Latency Time, t A A min, from J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification. This reinforces the regulatory and standardized nature of these timing parameters for ensuring interoperability and predictable performance of D D R three memory modules.In addition to the minimum C A S Latency, other timing parameters are also critical for memory performance. Table one presents key timing parameters for memory modules, categorized by speed grade. The speed grades denote different performance tiers, with corresponding data rates measured in mega transfers per second. The table includes target t R C D R P C L, R C D in nanoseconds, R P in nanoseconds, and C L in nanoseconds. For example, for speed grade minus one two five superscript one superscript two, the data rate is one thousand six hundred mega transfers per second, target t R C D R P C L is eleven dash eleven dash eleven, R C D is thirteen point seven five nanoseconds, R P is thirteen point seven five nanoseconds, and C L is thirteen point seven five nanoseconds.The S P D Field zero hex F eleven, Write Recovery Time, t w r min, is another critical parameter that must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor. This field, along with the minimum C A S Latency Time, provides essential information for configuring and optimizing memory performance. By understanding these timing parameters and their relationships, system designers and engineers can ensure that memory modules operate within specified performance boundaries, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system.
