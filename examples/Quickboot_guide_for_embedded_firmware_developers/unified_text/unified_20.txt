Intel processors can access two different address ranges, memory and I O, using different C P U op codes to access each range. The classic I A thirty two memory map, as illustrated in Figure two point three, provides a comprehensive overview of the system's memory organization. The top of physical memory limit is specific to the C P U and chipset, while the bottom one megabyte has all the backward compatibility legacy baggage from the original I B M P C.Below four gigabytes, there is a variety of ranges required to support newer technology platform-specific memory ranges needed to make the system work. Four gigabytes were chosen when thirty two bit hardware and operating systems were the norm, and there weren't any systems on the mainstream market that could hold four gigabytes of physical memory. It was all virtual at the time, but times have changed. Similarly, below the platform-specific ranges are the P C I memory ranges for prefetchable and non-prefetchable memory. Prefetchable memory can be cached and speculatively read by the C P U or direct memory access capable devices, optimizing data throughput for contiguous blocks. Non-prefetchable memory, typically used for device registers or memory-mapped I O, requires strict ordering and cannot be cached or speculatively accessed due to potential side effects or state changes upon read.D Ram occupies the lower region, from zero gigabytes to however much memory you have, called Top of Lower Memory, or T O L M, which is typically less than the total physical address space. For instance, in a system with four gigabytes of installed D Ram, a thirty two bit operating system like Windows X P might only report approximately three gigabytes of usable memory, because the remaining gigabyte is effectively shadowed or consumed by hardware mappings within the four gigabyte physical address space. The effective usable D Ram for the operating system and applications is therefore capped at a point often referred to as T O L M.However, it is possible that memory exists above four gigabytes and that D Ram will be accessible. This would be the top of memory or top of upper memory. The conceptual ability for D Ram to exist and be accessible above the four gigabyte boundary points to the evolution of memory addressing capabilities beyond the strictures of thirty two bit architectures. This necessitates mechanisms such as Physical Address Extension, or P A E, in thirty two bit systems, or the fundamental shift to sixty four bit processor architectures, which inherently support a much larger physical address space, allowing for much greater physical memory capacities and thus eliminating the four gigabyte barrier as a primary constraint for D Ram visibility.To recover the physical memory that used to hide behind the former virtual ranges lost to P C I memory, a trick in the memory-controller addressing is employed. This involves remapping that physical memory above the top of upper memory, making it available for system use. The Intel architecture full I O range is zero to sixty four kilobytes and is intended for register mapping of hardware devices. Just as legacy hardware and software was handled years ago, and for the universal good, maintaining backward compatibility is crucial to ensure that the hardware and software from years ago still works with modern machines.The P C I E specification supports I O Space for compatibility with legacy devices which require their use because it requires the ability to support existing I O device drivers with no modifications. Besides the simple fixed legacy I O ranges, there are Base Address Registers per device that are enumerated by the B I O S and or the operating system to suit their idea of perfection. P C I to P C I bridges also require a four K B minimum between them. Alternatively, the term Memory Mapped I O has nothing to do with actual I O space. It is memory space used by hardware, usually register space, that is accessed from a configurable base address register. While this mechanism is similar to that of I O access from a high level, the transactions are routed very differently and are fundamentally different beasts to the platform with different rules.The P C I E specification demonstrates a fundamental commitment to backward compatibility by retaining support for legacy I O Space. This design decision is crucial because it allows the continued operation of older peripheral devices and, more importantly, permits existing I O device drivers to function without requiring any modifications or recompilation. At the heart of this compatibility are the mechanisms for device resource enumeration and allocation. Beyond the traditional, often fixed, legacy I O ranges that were prevalent in earlier architectures, the P C I E standard relies heavily on Base Address Registers, or B A R s, located within each device's configuration space. These B A R s define the memory or I O address ranges required by the device. During system initialization, the B I O S, and subsequently the operating system, discovers and enumerates these devices, then reads their B A R values to dynamically assign non-overlapping address blocks for their registers and memory. This dynamic allocation is critical for the plug and play functionality that modern systems demand. P C I to P C I bridges, often referred to as P two P bridges, facilitate this hierarchical enumeration and address decoding across segments of the P C I E topology, ensuring that each device's address space is correctly mapped and accessible by the C P U. A notable requirement for these mappings is a minimum alignment or size of four K B, which often aligns with memory page granularities, optimizing for both memory management unit operations and cache efficiency where applicable. The fundamental challenge in computer architecture, particularly with historical systems like the I A thirty two, involves efficient management of the physical memory address space. A significant problem arose from a portion of physical memory becoming effectively inaccessible, often termed "lost," due to the mapping requirements of P C I devices and legacy system components.This specific issue is resolved through a sophisticated technique known as memory remapping, where the memory controller intervenes to relocate the physical addresses of D Ram modules that would otherwise reside within these reserved legacy virtual ranges. By applying this "trick" in the memory controller's addressing logic, physical memory that might otherwise be overshadowed by P C I or B I O S allocations is shifted to higher memory addresses, typically beyond the four gigabyte boundary, thereby making it available for system use. To fully grasp this concept, consider the classical I A thirty two memory map, which provides a comprehensive overview of the system's memory organization. The memory address space is divided into distinct regions, each with its own specific purpose and characteristics. The main D Ram occupies the largest continuous segment of lower memory, while the region immediately above it is traditionally designated for legacy system components. Moving further up the address space, there is a distinct block dedicated to P N P devices, followed by a section typically reserved for the B I O S firmware itself, alongside other system-level functions. The upper boundary of this entire memory map is designated as "Top of Memory Map," which is variable and contingent upon the specific C P U, chipset D Ram limits, and the operating system's configuration. A critical historical demarcation exists at the three gigabyte and four gigabyte boundaries, specifically labeled as "T O M," or Top Of Memory. This region marks a logical division, below which the system historically placed memory-mapped I O devices, B I O S, and other fixed address components, creating what amounts to a "hole" or "gap" in the physical address space that D Ram could not readily occupy, even if physical D Ram modules were installed there. The "L E G A C Y" designation underscores that this arrangement was maintained for backward compatibility with older software and hardware. The aforementioned remapping trick leverages the memory controller's ability to intercept address requests to this "hole" and redirect them to physical D Ram modules that are actually located at higher addresses, effectively recovering the D Ram that physically existed but was logically shadowed. This remapping is crucial for fully utilizing installed D Ram in modern systems that retain aspects of the I A thirty two architecture, especially those supporting greater than four gigabytes of D Ram. The Intel architecture defines a distinct I O address range, spanning from address zero to sixty four kilobytes, which is fundamentally different from the memory address space. Its primary purpose is for the register mapping of hardware devices, enabling the C P U to communicate with peripherals through specific I O ports rather than memory locations. While modern high-speed peripherals increasingly utilize memory-mapped I O for greater flexibility and bandwidth, this traditional I O port-based communication remains an integral part of the architecture. This persistence is a direct consequence of the paramount importance of maintaining backward compatibility, ensuring that legacy hardware and software components continue to function seamlessly within contemporary systems. The P C I E specification, a cornerstone of modern system architecture, demonstrates a fundamental commitment to backward compatibility by retaining support for legacy I O Space. This design decision is crucial because it allows the continued operation of older peripheral devices and, more importantly, permits existing I O device drivers to function without requiring any modifications or recompilation. This preserves significant investments in legacy hardware and software ecosystems, ensuring a smooth transition across generations of computing platforms despite profound changes in the underlying bus fabric and transaction protocols. At the heart of this compatibility are the mechanisms for device resource enumeration and allocation, which rely heavily on Base Address Registers, or B A R s, located within each device's configuration space. These B A R s define the memory or I O address ranges required by the device, and during system initialization, the B I O S, and subsequently the operating system, discovers and enumerates these devices, then reads their B A R values to dynamically assign non-overlapping address blocks for their registers and memory. This dynamic allocation is critical for the plug and play functionality that modern systems demand, and P C I to P C I bridges facilitate this hierarchical enumeration and address decoding across segments of the P C I E topology.
