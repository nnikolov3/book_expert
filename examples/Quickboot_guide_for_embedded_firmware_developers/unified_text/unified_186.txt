The encoding scheme detailed here defines a structured approach for identifying and categorizing reference raw cards through a combination of bit fields. Bit seven serves as the extension indicator, where a value of one signals the use of reference raw cards labeled AM through CB. Bits six through five specify the revision level of the card, with zero zero representing revision zero, zero one for revision one, one zero for revision two, and one one for revision three. When bit seven equals one, bits four through zero determine the specific reference raw card designation. For example, the binary pattern zero zero zero zero zero corresponds to reference raw card AM, while zero zero zero zero one maps to reference raw card AN. This encoding continues sequentially, assigning unique five-bit patterns to individual cards within the extended range. Binary zero zero zero one zero identifies reference raw card AP, and zero zero zero one one corresponds to reference raw card AR. As the sequence progresses, zero zero one zero zero maps to reference raw card AT, followed by zero zero one zero one for reference raw card AU, and zero zero one one zero for reference raw card AV. The pattern extends further with zero zero one one one indicating reference raw card AW, and zero one zero zero zero corresponding to reference raw card AY. Binary zero one zero zero one maps to reference raw card BA, while zero one zero one zero indicates reference raw card BB, and zero one zero one one corresponds to reference raw card BC. Continuing this enumeration, zero one one zero zero identifies reference raw card BD, and zero one one zero one maps to reference raw card BE. Binary zero one one one zero corresponds to reference raw card BF, and zero one one one one indicates reference raw card BG. The sequence proceeds with one zero zero zero zero for reference raw card BH, one zero zero zero one for reference raw card BI, and one zero zero one zero for reference raw card BJ. Additionally, one zero zero one one maps to reference raw card BK, one zero one zero zero corresponds to reference raw card BL, and one zero one zero one indicates reference raw card BM. Finally, one zero one one zero maps to reference raw card BN, demonstrating the systematic allocation of binary codes to distinct card identifiers within this extended configuration framework.
