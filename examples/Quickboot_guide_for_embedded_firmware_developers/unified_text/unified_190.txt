The Serial Presence Detect (SPD) data structure plays a critical role in the identification and configuration of memory modules such as DRAM by a system's CPU. Within this structure, specific byte ranges are designated for unique identifiers and error detection mechanisms to ensure proper module recognition and data integrity. Bytes one hundred twenty two through one hundred twenty five are allocated as a tester ID byte, while the remaining bytes from one hundred seventeen to one hundred twenty five form a nine-byte unique module identifier. It is important to note that this identifier does not include the actual part number of the memory module; rather, it serves to distinguish different modules. Suppliers must ensure that they do not assign the same value to bytes one hundred nineteen through one hundred twenty five for more than one DIMM, even if those DIMMs have different part numbers, thereby maintaining uniqueness across modules.SPD fields hexadecimal zero seven E and hexadecimal zero seven F are specifically defined as CRC bytes, implementing a Cyclical Redundancy Code for error detection. CRC algorithms utilize polynomial division in a finite field to generate a checksum that can detect accidental changes to raw data. In this case, the CRC bytes must be calculated over bytes zero through one hundred twenty five using the specified CRC-16 algorithm. If bit seven of SPD field zero is set to one binary, which is not recommended, then the CRC validation should instead apply to bytes zero through one hundred sixteen. To assist with these calculations, a useful online resource is available at the website www dot lammertbies dot nl slash comm slash info slash crc calculation dot html. When using this tool, all spaces between bytes must be removed and the "Hex" option selected instead of "ASCII" to ensure accurate computation.The implementation of the CRC-16 algorithm in code initializes a sixteen-bit integer variable crc to zero. A while loop processes each byte of the input data as long as the count variable remains greater than zero. Within the loop, the current byte pointed to by ptr is XORed with the high byte of the crc register, after which the crc register is shifted left by eight bits and ptr is incremented by one. For each bit in the data, an if condition checks whether the most significant bit of the crc register is set by performing a bitwise AND operation with hexadecimal eight zero zero zero. If the condition evaluates true, the crc value is shifted left by one bit and XORed with hexadecimal one zero two one, representing the CRC-16-CCITT polynomial commonly used in such implementations. Otherwise, the crc value is simply shifted left by one bit. After processing all bytes, the function returns the final crc value masked with hexadecimal F F F F to retain only sixteen bits.This CRC function is typically applied to an array such as spdBytes, which contains SPD byte zero through SPD byte N minus one, representing data read from the SPD chip on a memory module. The resulting sixteen-bit CRC value is stored in the variable datal6. Bytes one hundred twenty six and one hundred twenty seven of the SPD structure are designated to hold this computed CRC, with byte one hundred twenty six containing the least significant byte and byte one hundred twenty seven holding the most significant byte. These fields are explicitly defined under "SPD Field one hundred twenty six and one hundred twenty seven: CRC Bytes Definition from JEDEC DDR3 SPD Specification," confirming their role in validating the integrity of preceding SPD data.Continuing with the SPD structure, bytes one hundred twenty eight through one hundred forty five, corresponding to hexadecimal eight zero through hexadecimal nine one, are reserved for the Module Part Number. This field stores the manufacturer's part number in ASCII format. Any unused positions within this range are coded as ASCII blanks, represented by hexadecimal two zero. In scenarios where a physical DIMM is not present, the SDRAM component name may be used in place of the module part number. For converting ASCII strings to hexadecimal representations, the website easycalculation dot com slash ascii hex dot php provides a helpful utility, with the recommendation to use the "Equivalent Hex Value" output for consistency.Following the part number field, bytes one hundred forty six and one hundred forty seven represent the Module Revision Code, labeled as SPD fields hexadecimal nine two and hexadecimal nine three. For down-on-board memory designs, these bytes should be set to hexadecimal zero zero. While the SPD specification does not define a standard format for this revision code, individual manufacturers maintain their own tracking and decoding methods for these bytes. The typical value assigned to this field is hexadecimal zero zero zero zero, indicating no revision information or a default state.Finally, bytes one hundred forty eight and one hundred forty nine, corresponding to SPD fields hexadecimal nine four and hexadecimal nine five, contain the DRAM Manufacturer ID Code. These bytes should use the same value found in fields hexadecimal seventy five and seventy six, which represent the SDRAM component manufacturer ID as defined by the JEP one hundred six JEDEC specification. For example, Micron Technology is represented by the value hexadecimal eight zero two C, with byte one hundred forty eight storing the least significant byte and byte one hundred forty nine containing the most significant byte. This two-byte field ensures accurate identification of the DRAM supplier within the memory module.
