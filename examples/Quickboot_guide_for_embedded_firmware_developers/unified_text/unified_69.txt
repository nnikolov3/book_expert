The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I, environment provides a robust framework for developing applications that interact with the underlying hardware and system services. At its core, U E F I offers an Application Programming Interface, or A P I, that enables applications to leverage various services provided by the U E F I firmware. A typical entry point for a U E F I application is the `UefiMain` function, which receives a handle representing the image of the current application and a pointer to the system table. The system table is a crucial data structure in U E F I, acting as a central repository of pointers to various services.To perform output operations, a U E F I application accesses the console output device through the system table, specifically by dereferencing the `SystemTable` pointer to access the console output interface, `ConOut`. The `OutputString` function is then invoked, taking the console output device pointer and a string as arguments. For instance, the string "Hello World" is represented as a Unicode, wide-character string literal, denoted by the `L` prefix. Following the output operation, the function returns `E F I _ S U C C E S S`, signaling that the operation completed without errors.In contrast, a U E F I Shell application would replace the call to `OutputString` with a call to `ShellPrintEx`, which is part of the U E F I Shell's programmatic interface. The `ShellPrintEx` function is also used for outputting text to the console, with parameters that may include options for line wrapping or other formatting. The core similarity between U E F I applications and U E F I Shell applications lies in their ability to display strings, such as "Hello World", to the console.However, the difference between U E F I applications and U E F I Shell applications becomes more apparent when file input/output operations are involved. A U E F I Shell application can open a file using the `OpenByName` method, which is part of the `gShellProtocol`. This protocol encapsulates shell-specific services, including file operations. In contrast, a U E F I application would need to use a more fundamental approach, such as searching for a file path explicitly.The U E F I environment also supports script files, which are plain text files that can be easily modified without specialized tools. These script files can be used for repetitive tasks, such as outputting the current memory information to a log file and comparing it with a known good version. However, script files have limitations, as they cannot perform tasks that are not already encapsulated in a shell command or an existing shell application. For example, opening a network connection and sending information to a remote platform would be better suited for an application rather than a script.Applications in the U E F I environment have the power to open and interact with any protocol and any handle present in the system, possessing the same privileges and rights as a U E F I driver. This means that an application can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple output operations to complex interactions with system services. In contrast, scripts are limited to tasks that are already supported by shell commands or existing applications, making them suitable for automation of repetitive tasks but not for complex or customized operations.The code snippet provided demonstrates a basic shell script that tests the `GOTO` script-only command, showcasing control flow mechanisms such as unconditional jumps and loops. The script begins by printing "1 - START" to the standard output, followed by an unconditional jump to the label `:label1`. Before the jump, it prints "1 - NO". The script then enters a loop, printing "1 - NO" for each iteration, and finally prints "1 - END" after the loop completes.In summary, the U E F I environment provides a robust framework for developing applications that interact with the underlying hardware and system services. While U E F I applications and U E F I Shell applications share some similarities, they differ in their approach to file input/output operations and their capabilities. Script files, on the other hand, are suitable for repetitive tasks but have limitations compared to applications, which can perform a wide range of tasks with the same privileges as a U E F I driver.
