The boot process of an embedded system is a critical aspect that requires careful consideration, particularly when transitioning from a simple prototype to high-volume manufacturing. A key component of this process is the blind handoff to disk, where the system firmware initiates a transfer of control to a known disk address without explicit verification. This approach is preferred by Real-Time Operating System (R T O S) vendors who do not call back into system firmware during runtime and have not yet implemented either a legacy Operating System (O S) interface or an Extensible Firmware Interface (E F I) interface.Loading an operating system after platform initialization can be accomplished through various methods, with known and tested standards generally representing the most efficient and straightforward approaches. However, more sophisticated embedded solutions may require deeper consideration and may involve moving beyond simple laboratory setups to more complex real-world environments. The overarching recommendation is to carefully evaluate and select the boot path and associated methods based on the specific requirements and scale of the system. With E F I, one is not necessarily constrained to a single, monolithic boot solution, implying greater flexibility and modularity in the boot process compared to legacy Basic Input/Output System (B I O S) systems.The Intel architecture boot flow is a complex process that involves a series of carefully orchestrated steps. The bare minimum firmware requirements for making an Intel architecture platform operational and for booting an O S are presented in a specific order. Design choices or market segment requirements might necessitate modifications, such as adding, deleting, or reordering these steps. However, the fundamental sequence presented is sufficient for the vast majority of system designs. This sequence dictates the transition from a power-off state to the initial handoff to the O S's B I O S.When external power is first applied to a platform, the hardware platform must carry out a number of tasks before the Central Processing Unit (C P U) can be brought out of reset. The first task is to allow the power supply to settle down to its nominal state; once the primary power supply settles, there are usually a number of derived voltage levels needed on the platform. For example, on the Intel architecture reference platform, the input supply consists of a twelve-volt source, but the platform and processor require a number of different voltage rails, such as one point five volts, three point three volts, five volts, and twelve volts. The platform and processor also require that the voltages are provided in a particular sequence, a process known as power sequencing, which takes place by controlling analog switches, typically field effect transistors. The sequence is often driven by a Complex Program Logic Device (C P L D). The platform clocks are also derived from a small number of input clock and oscillator sources, using phase-locked loop circuitry to generate the derived clocks used for the platform. These clocks also take time to converge.As part of the Intel architecture, a variety of subsystems may begin prior to the main host system starting. This nonhost-based subsystem startup is an essential aspect of the boot process, allowing for the initialization of critical components before the main processor is activated. The power sequencing C P L D de-asserts the reset line to the processor once all the necessary steps have occurred, enabling the C P U to commence its instruction execution cycle. Depending on the integration of silicon features, some of this logic may be on-chip and controlled by microcontroller firmware, which starts prior to the main processor. This intricate process underscores the complexity and nuance of the Intel architecture boot flow, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms to ensure successful system startup and operation.
