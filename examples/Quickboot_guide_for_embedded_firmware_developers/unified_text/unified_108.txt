The boot process of a computing platform is a complex sequence of events that can be optimized for faster startup times. One significant factor influencing boot time is the type of boot media used. Traditional rotating magnetic media, such as hard disk drives, introduce latency due to the mechanical requirement for spindle spin-up, which can range from one to five seconds or even longer. In contrast, solid-state drives, or S S D's, eliminate this mechanical spin-up requirement, resulting in substantially reduced boot times. The choice of boot media is therefore a critical factor in optimizing system startup performance, as demonstrated by the estimated two-second saving achieved by using an S S D over a spinning drive.Another crucial aspect of the boot process is the system's basic input output system, or B I O S. The B I O S plays a vital role in platform initialization and can be a point for recovery or updates. A B I O S update or recovery process can impact overall platform performance, and the specific mechanisms employed are often designed with consideration for variability. Understanding how a B I O S update is achieved from a user's perspective involves examining common scenarios. One such scenario is a user initiating an operating system application that downloads an update from the original equipment manufacturer's, or O E M's, website, which subsequently triggers a system reboot. Another common method involves a user downloading a specific file from an O E M website, placing it onto a Universal Serial Bus, or U S B, dongle, and then rebooting the platform with the U S B dongle attached. A third scenario describes a user obtaining a special file via a compact disc, or C D, or a flash drive, and then using this media to initiate the B I O S update utility upon system reboot. These distinct user-initiated pathways typically converge during the platform's initialization phase, specifically within the B I O S, to execute the update or recovery operation.The question of how to notify the B I O S that the platform is in recovery mode is also an important consideration. Depending on the platform policy, this method can vary greatly. One option is to always probe a given set of possible data repositories, such as U S B media, a C D, or maybe even the network, for recovery content. However, this approach can be time-consuming and may not be conducive to quick boot times. A more preferable approach is to have a platform-specific action that is easy and quick to probe, which "turns on" the recovery mode. Examples of this include holding down a particular key, maybe associated with a General Purpose Input Output, or G P I O, flipping a switch, equivalent to moving a jumper, that can be probed, and so on. These methods allow a platform to run without much burden, eliminating the need for extensive probing for update or recovery.In addition to these considerations, the display of an O E M splash screen can also impact boot time. While the splash screen itself may not consume a significant amount of time, initializing the video device to enable its display can be a time-consuming process, potentially taking around three hundred milliseconds. The decision to display or eliminate a splash screen is influenced by what is deemed paramount for the O E M delivering the platform. If rapid boot times are the priority, the splash screen might be omitted entirely. Conversely, if branding is of higher importance, the splash screen might be retained, even if it extends the initialization period. Engineers can leverage U E F I event services to manage marketing-driven delays, potentially allowing other initialization tasks to proceed concurrently with the splash screen display, thus mitigating the perceived delay.Ultimately, the goal is to boot the target operating system as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that the platform is properly initialized and configured. By understanding the factors that influence boot time, such as boot media, B I O S updates, and splash screen display, engineers can design platforms that optimize startup performance, providing a better user experience.
