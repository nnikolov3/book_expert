The document presents a comprehensive overview of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) configuration, focusing on timing parameters, addressing schemes, and Serial Presence Detect (SPD) fields. The timing parameters, such as delay from start of internal write transaction to internal read command, read to precharge time, and CAS to CAS command delay, are defined by specific mnemonics and expressed as a minimum number of clock cycles. For instance, the delay from the start of an internal write transaction to an internal read command, denoted as 'WTR', requires a minimum of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds, whichever is greater.The addressing schemes vary across different SDRAM configurations, as illustrated in Table 2. The table presents parameters for different configurations, including 512 Meg by 4, 256 Meg by 8, and 128 Meg by 16. For each configuration, it specifies the overall memory organization in terms of capacity and data bus width, along with the number of banks. The row addressing, bank addressing, and column addressing schemes are also detailed for each configuration. For example, in the 512 Meg by 4 configuration, the row addressing is 32K (A[14:0]), the bank addressing uses 8 bits (BA[2:0]), and the column addressing is 2K (A[11:0]).The document also delves into specific SPD fields relevant to SDRAM capabilities. SPD Field 29, labeled as "Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time (tFAWmin) LSB," is cited from a Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet. This field represents the least significant byte of the tFAWmin timing parameter, which is an example of how vendor-specific timing details are communicated through SPD.SPD Field 30, "SDRAM Optional Features," defines support for certain SDRAM features and drive strengths. The field is structured as a bitfield, where individual bits or groups of bits encode distinct features. Bit 7 is designated for DLL-Off Mode Support, while bits 6 through 2 are reserved. Bit 1 is labeled "RZQ/7," and bit 0 is labeled "RZQ/6," both of which define the specific impedance or termination strategy employed by the SDRAM.The Mode Register 1 (MR1) definition is also presented, which is part of SPD Field 30. The MR1 register controls various operational aspects of the memory device, including DLL Enable status, TOQS, Output Drive Strength, Additive Latency, and Write Localization. The M12 and Q08 bits control the DLL Enable status, while the M11 and TOQS bits control TOQS. The M5 and M1 bits control Output Drive Strength, and the M4 and M3 bits control Additive Latency.Byte 31, titled SDRAM Thermal and Refresh Options, describes the module's supported operating temperature ranges and refresh options. The values come from the DDR3 SDRAM datasheet, and the use of self-refresh in the Extended Temperature Range, ASR, or ODTS requires appropriate SDRAM Mode Register programming.In summary, the document provides a detailed overview of SDRAM configuration, including timing parameters, addressing schemes, and SPD fields. The information is crucial for ensuring the correct and efficient operation of memory interfaces within a computing system. The SPD fields, such as SDRAM Optional Features and SDRAM Thermal and Refresh Options, provide essential information about the capabilities and operational characteristics of the SDRAM module. The Mode Register 1 definition and configuration are also critical for controlling various operational aspects of the memory device.
