The Serial Presence Detect (SPD) standard plays a critical role in the proper identification and configuration of memory modules such as DRAM DIMMs. This standard defines how information about a module's capabilities, timing parameters, and manufacturer details are stored on a small EEPROM chip present on the module itself. The system firmware, typically BIOS or UEFI, reads this data during initialization to configure the memory controller appropriately for optimal operation.Within the SPD data structure, byte offsets one hundred seventeen and one hundred eighteen are dedicated to encoding the "Module Manufacture ID Code." These bytes follow the guidelines established by JEDEC standard JEP-106, which specifies a method for uniquely identifying manufacturers through a combination of bank numbers, manufacturer codes, and continuation bytes. For example, Fujitsu is represented with a bank value of one, a code of zero four, zero continuation codes, resulting in SPD byte one hundred seventeen set to hexadecimal eight zero and byte one hundred eighteen set to hexadecimal zero four. In contrast, US Modular uses a bank value of five, a code of A eight, four continuation codes, yielding SPD byte one hundred seventeen as hexadecimal zero four and byte one hundred eighteen as hexadecimal A eight. This encoding scheme allows systems to unambiguously determine the manufacturer of any given memory module.Byte offset one hundred nineteen, designated as SPD field hexadecimal seventy seven, encodes the "Module Manufacturer Location." While JEDEC does not provide a universal decode table for all manufacturing sites, each manufacturer is expected to maintain its own mapping of facility identifiers. This byte enables tracking of where a module was produced, which can be valuable for quality assurance, warranty claims, and supply chain logistics. The value stored here is manufacturer-specific and must be interpreted according to internal records maintained by the respective module producer.The manufacturing date is encoded in bytes one hundred twenty and one hundred twenty one, corresponding to SPD fields hexadecimal seventy eight and seventy nine. These bytes utilize Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) representation, where each four-bit nibble corresponds to a single decimal digit. The upper byte, one hundred twenty, contains the last two digits of the year, while the lower byte, one hundred twenty one, holds the week number. For instance, a module manufactured in the fourth week of two thousand ten would store hexadecimal one zero in byte one hundred twenty and hexadecimal zero four in byte one hundred twenty one. This standardized approach ensures consistent temporal tracking of module production across different manufacturers and systems.For module identification beyond the manufacturer and date, bytes one hundred twenty two through one hundred twenty five are reserved for the "Module Serial Number." Though not physically required when no module is installed, this field is essential for BIOS algorithms to detect whether a DIMM has been replaced or altered, which influences boot path selection between fast and slow initialization routines. Suppliers must ensure that each module receives a unique serial number, and they have flexibility in choosing their encoding method. One common approach involves using one byte within this range as a tester identification field and the remaining bytes for sequential numbering, thereby creating a unique identifier across the production line.It is important to emphasize that this nine-byte identifier spanning from byte one hundred seventeen to one hundred twenty five does not include the module's part number. Consequently, suppliers must avoid assigning identical values to bytes one hundred nineteen through one hundred twenty five for different DIMMs, even if those modules differ only in part number. This ensures that each module maintains a globally unique identifier within the SPD structure, supporting reliable tracking and configuration.Finally, bytes one hundred twenty six and one hundred twenty seven, corresponding to SPD fields hexadecimal seventy E and seventy F, contain the Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) values. These two bytes store a calculated CRC-16 checksum covering all preceding SPD bytes from zero through one hundred twenty five. The CRC algorithm ensures data integrity by allowing the system to verify that the SPD contents have not been corrupted or altered. Bit seven of byte zero in the SPD structure determines whether the CRC covers bytes zero through one hundred sixteen or zero through one hundred twenty five. While both options are technically valid, it is recommended that the full range be used for consistency and completeness. To compute the CRC, all bytes must be concatenated without spaces, and the calculation must be performed using hexadecimal input rather than ASCII. Tools such as the CRC calculator available at lammertbies.nl can assist in generating accurate CRC-16 values for SPD programming.
