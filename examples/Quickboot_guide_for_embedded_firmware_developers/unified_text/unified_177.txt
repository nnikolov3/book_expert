The table presents a detailed breakdown of command and address timing parameters for different Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D Ram, generations, specifically DDR3-800, DDR3-1066, DDR3-1333, and DDR3-1600. These timings are critical for ensuring reliable data transfer between the memory controller and the D Ram modules. Each parameter, identified by a symbol, is quantified by minimum and maximum values, often expressed in clock cycles, denoted as C K, or in picoseconds, p s, and nanoseconds, n s. The variations across the different DDR3 speeds highlight the trade-offs between performance and timing requirements.The first parameter, 'RPST', DQS, DQS number differential READ postamble, is measured in clock cycles. For DDR3-800 and DDR3-1066, the minimum is zero point three C K, with a maximum specified as a note, indicating it's tied to a specific operational condition or revision. For DDR3-1333 and DDR3-1600, the minimum remains zero point three C K, with a similar note for the maximum. The postamble is a small time window after the data burst that aids in signal integrity.The section on Command and Address Timings delves into more granular control signals. 'DLLK', D L L locking time, is presented in picoseconds. Across all DDR3 speeds, it consistently has a minimum value of five hundred twelve picoseconds and no specified maximum, suggesting a critical alignment window for the delay lock loop to synchronize. Next are 'ADDR setup' and 'ADDR hold' times, measured relative to the clock signal, C K, or C K number. These are further broken down into 'Base' and '(Specification)' values. For instance, 'ADDR setup to C K, C K number' has base values of two hundred picoseconds for DDR3-800, one hundred twenty five picoseconds for DDR3-1066, sixty five picoseconds for DDR3-1333, and forty five picoseconds for DDR3-1600.The '(Specification)' values further refine these with details like "Vref at one volt per nanosecond," implying a dependency on voltage slew rate. Similarly, 'ADDR hold from C K, C K number' shows minimum values of three hundred fifty picoseconds for DDR3-800, with decreases for faster standards, down to two hundred twenty picoseconds for DDR3-1600. These setup and hold times are fundamental concepts in synchronous digital design, ensuring that data is stable at the sampling edge of the clock.The 'Minimum C T R L, C M D, A D D R pulse width' is given as 'IPW'. For DDR3-800, the minimum pulse width is nine hundred picoseconds, reducing to seven hundred eighty picoseconds for DDR3-1066, six hundred twenty picoseconds for DDR3-1333, and no value is provided for DDR3-1600, likely indicated by a note. This parameter ensures that command and address signals are held for a sufficient duration to be reliably captured by the memory controller.The timings 'ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay' denoted by 'RCD', and 'PRECHARGE command period' denoted by 'RP', are specified by referencing "Speed Bin Tables" for their respective values in nanoseconds. These parameters relate to the internal operations within the D Ram chip itself, such as activating rows and precharging them for subsequent access. Similarly, 'ACTIVATE to PRECHARGE command period' and 'ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE command' are also referenced to speed bin tables, with their values in nanoseconds.The table then details 'ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE minimum command period' and 'Four ACTIVATE windows'. These are further subdivided by 'one kilobyte page size' and 'two kilobyte page size'. For instance, the minimum command period between successive ACTIVATE commands varies based on the page size and memory speed. The minimum command period is defined as the greater of four clock cycles or a specified number of nanoseconds, which changes across different DDR3 speeds.The 'Four ACTIVATE windows' parameter, symbolized as 'FAW', specifies the minimum number of clock cycles or nanoseconds within which a certain number of ACTIVATE commands can be issued. For example, for DDR3-800, the minimum FAW is forty nanoseconds or thirty seven point five nanoseconds. The values decrease for higher speed bins, reflecting the increased signaling frequencies. The presence of 'one kilobyte page size' and 'two kilobyte page size' indicates how memory organization affects these timing constraints, demonstrating the interplay between architectural choices and performance.In addition to these parameters, the document also discusses the representation of S D Ram timing values within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure. Specifically, it details the mapping of S D Ram timing values into the S P D format, which is crucial for system initialization and configuration. For instance, "Write recovery time" has a minimum of fifteen nanoseconds, and "Delay from start of internal WRITE transaction to internal READ command" has a minimum constraint expressed as the greater of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds.The text also focuses on "S P D Field number twenty seven: Minimum Internal Read to Precharge Command Delay Time," citing the Micron M T forty one J two hundred fifty six M eight Datasheet. This highlights how specific, performance-critical timing parameters are encoded within the S P D structure, allowing the system's memory controller to ascertain the capabilities and optimal operating settings of the installed S D Ram modules.Furthermore, the document explains the interpretation of specific S P D fields within the J E D E C D D R three S P D specification, focusing on the minimum four activate window delay, denoted as t F A W min. This parameter is crucial for memory timing and controller operation. The t F A W value is extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor to obtain the value that is then encoded into the S P D field. For example, a t F A W value of thirty seven point five nanoseconds is divided by a Medium Timebase Divisor of zero point one two five nanoseconds, resulting in a value that is then split into an upper nibble and a lower nibble for encoding into the S P D fields.Overall, the detailed breakdown of command and address timing parameters for different D Ram generations, along with the representation of these parameters within the S P D data structure, underscores the meticulous timing requirements inherent in high-speed memory interfaces. Each clock cycle and nanosecond plays a role in achieving optimal data throughput and system stability, highlighting the importance of precise timing control in synchronous dynamic random access memory operations.
