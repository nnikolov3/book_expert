The implications of software licensing are multifaceted, and understanding the specific terms of a proprietary license is crucial. Proprietary licenses define the rules for distribution and reusability of software, and developers must be meticulous in understanding how these terms are defined, as they can vary significantly. It is essential to seek fresh advice from professionals, such as lawyers, when dealing with these terms, as they are not static and can be complex. Assuming that new team members, or even experienced ones, will inherently understand all licensing terms is a risky proposition, and it is vital to walk them through the company norms.A proprietary license puts any development performed during the negotiation timeframe at risk of being unusable, as the people you license from will also be potentially interested in your licensing terms, and it may take each party's lawyers many months to walk through everything and agree, should the need arise. Many name-brand software packages come with forms of a proprietary license, while some companies offer proprietary software for free, which is often referred to as freeware. This distinction is important in understanding the business models associated with software distribution.In contrast to proprietary licenses, the Berkeley Software Distribution, or B S D, license offers a more permissive approach. There are three versions of the BSD license to consider, with varying degrees of compatibility between proprietary and G P L licenses. The original BSD license had four key clauses, which mandated the preservation of the original copyright notice, required acknowledgment in advertising and promotional materials, and prohibited the use of the names of the original developers or their associated organizations to endorse or promote products derived from the software without explicit prior written consent. However, the four-clause BSD license was not G P L compatible, and the mandatory product message advertising the BSD developers was not wanted by product developers downstream.The newer BSD license, characterized by three clauses, is compatible with G P L. The third clause appears to be a significant point of consideration, as it stipulates that neither the name of the organization nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. In addition to the three-clause version, there is also a simplified BSD license, with two clauses, that is similar in that it is compatible with G P L. The two clauses require that redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, and redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.One key benefit of the BSD license is that companies that create their own proprietary software can take BSD-licensed code to start with, create derivative works, or augment their existing code. Companies that create their own firmware or software regularly take the BSD drivers that are created by silicon vendors and integrate them into their offerings. For instance, Intel B L D K uses a form of this license for the reused Tiano-based source code that it releases. This compatibility allows for the integration of BSD-licensed code into projects that are themselves licensed under the G P L, fostering a more permissive ecosystem for software development and distribution. By understanding the nuances of the BSD license and its compatibility with other licenses, developers can make informed decisions about how to utilize open-source code in their projects, ultimately driving innovation and collaboration in the software development community.
