The script provided is a simple functional test of the `GOTO` script-only command. It begins with `echo "one - START"`, which prints the string "one - START" to the standard output. Following this, `GOTO label one` signifies an unconditional jump to the line marked by the label `:label one`. Before the jump, `echo "one - NO"` is executed. The loop structure is defined by `FOR percentage A IN A B C echo "one - NO"`. This construct iterates over the elements "A", "B", and "C". For each iteration, the command `echo "one - NO"` is executed. However, the presence of the `GOTO label one` within the loop's scope implies a potentially complex or unintended execution path depending on the shell's interpretation of `GOTO` relative to loop constructs. The script's execution would proceed as follows: print "one - START", then print "one - NO", then jump to `:label one`. At `:label one`, the command `echo "one - NO"` is executed again. The `ENDFOR` statement marks the termination of the loop, which, in this specific code, is never actually entered because the `GOTO` statement diverts execution before the loop's body can be reached. Finally, `echo "one - END"` would be printed after the `ENDFOR` block.The accompanying text discusses the utility and limitations of script files. Script files are presented as effective for repetitive tasks, such as outputting current memory information to a log file. However, a significant limitation is identified: script files cannot perform actions not already encapsulated within a shell command or an existing shell application. This contrasts with applications, which are described as having the power to interact with any protocol and handle system resources with privileges and rights akin to a UEFI driver.The power behind script files is that they can do large amounts of repetitive work with less overhead than required for an application. They can fully exercise shell commands and applications with much less development overhead than an application. Script files require no compiler or any development tools at all. They can even be edited via the edit command in the shell and then rerun without using any other software.For example, a loop can be used to perform a desired action a specified number of times. The loop structure can be defined using a `FOR` statement, which iterates over a range of values. The `echo` command can be used to print a message to the standard output during each iteration. By modifying the loop to use a parameter as the termination condition, the script can be made more generic and adaptable to different use cases.The UEFI Shell is designed to allow for customization, with sixty-four possible combinations of shell levels and shell profiles. For initial silicon bring-up and debugging, it is recommended to use a level three shell with all profiles installed. This provides the largest feature set, although it results in the biggest binary size. The UEFI Shell runs on top of the UEFI drivers, and its components can be separated into required and optional parts, allowing for easy customization and modification.To add a custom command set to the UEFI Shell, a NULL-Named-Library can be added to the shell via a DSC file. The new library must use the API from UefiShellCommandLib to register its commands with the shell core. The registration includes the name of the command, a function pointer to be called when the command is run, a required level, the name of the profile, and the identifier for the help content in HII. This information is used to populate required shell features, such as environment variable profiles and help content.
