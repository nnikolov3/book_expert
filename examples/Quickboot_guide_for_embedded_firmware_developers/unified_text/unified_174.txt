The document outlines the timing parameters for Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) memory interfaces, specifically focusing on various frequencies such as eight hundred megahertz, one thousand sixty six megahertz, one thousand three hundred thirty three megahertz, and sixteen hundred megahertz. These parameters are categorized into several sections, including Calibration Timing, Initialization and Reset Timing, Refresh Timing, and Self Refresh Timing.Within the Calibration Timing section, several parameters are defined, each with minimum and maximum values specified in clock cycles or units of time. For instance, the multi-purpose register burst end to mode register exit has a minimum requirement of one clock cycle, with no maximum specified. Long calibration operations require a minimum of five hundred twelve clock cycles, while short calibration operations require sixty four clock cycles.The Initialization and Reset Timing section outlines critical durations for bringing the Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) out of reset and into an operational state. The time required to exit reset from a high state to a valid command has a minimum duration defined as the greater of five clock cycles or the refresh command period plus ten nanoseconds. The power supply ramp-up time to stable levels has a maximum of two hundred milliseconds, while the reset time to low has a minimum of zero milliseconds and a maximum of two hundred milliseconds.The Refresh Timing section details the intervals and durations associated with the DRAM's refresh operations, crucial for maintaining data integrity. The refresh to activate or refresh command period varies based on the DRAM density, with minimum and maximum refresh periods specified for one gigabyte, two gigabyte, and four gigabyte modules. The maximum refresh period is further broken down by temperature conditions, with sixty four clock cycles for temperatures less than or equal to eighty five degrees Celsius and thirty two clock cycles for temperatures greater than eighty five degrees Celsius.The Self Refresh Timing section specifies parameters for operating the DRAM in a low power self-refresh mode. Exiting self-refresh to commands not requiring a locked Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) component has a minimum timing determined by the greater of the system clock or the refresh command period plus ten nanoseconds. The minimum clock enable low pulse width for self-refresh exit timing is defined by the clock enable and the system clock.In addition to these timing parameters, the document also discusses the interpretation of specific Serial Presence Detect (SPD) fields, which are crucial for configuring memory modules. SPD fields twenty four and twenty five represent the Minimum Refresh Recovery Delay Time, while SPD field zero times one A defines the Minimum Write to Read Command Delay. These values are derived from the memory module's datasheet and processed by a Medium Timebase Divisor to obtain the required timing parameters.The Minimum Internal Write to Read Command Delay Time, denoted as tWTRmin, is defined in SPD field number twenty six. This value is expressed in Medium Timebase units and is dependent on the DRAM page size. Controller designers must note that at some frequencies, a minimum number of clocks may be required, resulting in a larger tWTRmin value than indicated in the SPD. For example, tWTRmin for DDR3-800 must be four clocks.The document also provides an example of how to calculate the tWTRmin value, using the Medium Timebase Divisor and the raw tWTR value found in the datasheet. The result is then compared to the defined values in the SPD specification to ensure accurate configuration of the memory module. Overall, the document provides a comprehensive overview of the timing parameters and SPD field interpretations required for configuring and optimizing DDR3 memory interfaces.
