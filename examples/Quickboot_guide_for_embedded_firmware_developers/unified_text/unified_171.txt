The configuration of SDRAM memory modules requires the fulfillment of specific timing parameters, including the clock signal, CAS Latency, and CWL Latency. To ensure proper system initialization and memory controller configuration, it is crucial to extract and interpret these parameters from the Serial Presence Detect, or SPD, data structure. The SPD data provides vital information about the memory module, including its timing characteristics.One critical parameter is the Minimum Active to Precharge Delay Time, denoted as tRASmin, which represents the minimum time interval between the activation of a row and the subsequent precharge command for that same row in a DRAM. This parameter is typically extracted from the memory module's datasheet and must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor to obtain the correct value. For example, if the tRASmin value is fifty point six two five nanoseconds, and the Medium Timebase Divisor is zero point one two five nanoseconds, the resulting value would be four hundred and five, which is equivalent to hexadecimal one nine five.Another essential parameter is the Minimum Active to Active Refresh Delay, denoted as tRCmin, which is the minimum time between consecutive active commands to different rows or the minimum time between an active command and a refresh command. This parameter is also extracted from the datasheet and requires consideration of the Medium Timebase Divisor. The tRCmin value is typically represented in the SPD data as a twelve-bit value, with the upper nibble of Byte twenty-one and the contents of Byte twenty-three combined to form the complete value.The table provided shows the relationship between the tRC values in Medium Timebase units, the corresponding MTB values in nanoseconds, the tRC Offset values in Fine Timebase units, the FTB values in nanoseconds, and the resulting tRC values in nanoseconds. The table also specifies the memory type associated with each tRC value, such as DDR3-800D, DDR3-1066E, and DDR3-1600K. For instance, when the tRC value is four hundred, the MTB is zero point one two five nanoseconds, the tRC Offset is zero, the FTB is zero point zero zero one nanoseconds, and the resulting tRC value is fifty nanoseconds, which corresponds to the DDR3-800D memory type.The calculation of the tRC value involves dividing the tRC value in Medium Timebase units by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which is typically zero point one two five nanoseconds. The resulting value is then adjusted by the tRC Offset value in Fine Timebase units, which is usually zero. The final tRC value is obtained by adding the adjusted value to the tRC Offset value. This calculation is critical for ensuring that the memory controller configures the memory module correctly and operates within the specified timing parameters.In summary, the extraction and interpretation of timing parameters from the SPD data structure are crucial for proper system initialization and memory controller configuration. The tRASmin and tRCmin parameters are essential for ensuring that the memory module operates within the specified timing parameters, and their calculation involves careful consideration of the Medium Timebase Divisor and the tRC Offset value. By understanding these parameters and their relationships, system designers and developers can ensure that their systems operate efficiently and reliably.
