This document details the interpretation of Byte 62 from a system's serial presence detect, or SPD, data, specifically focusing on its role in identifying the "Reference Raw Card Used" for module assembly. This byte serves as a crucial metadata field, indicating which reference design board or "raw card" was employed during the development and manufacturing of the memory module. The information encoded within this byte is vital for ensuring compatibility and proper function, especially in the context of standardized electronic components.The byte is structured into distinct fields: bit 7 and bits six through five, and bits four through zero. Bit 7 acts as a flag, differentiating between the use of a standard reference raw card and other configurations. Specifically, a value of zero in bit 7 signifies the use of a standard reference raw card. The subsequent bits, six and five, are allocated for encoding the revision level of that reference raw card. A value of binary zero zero in these bits indicates revision zero, and subsequent binary combinations, such as binary zero one, binary one zero, and binary one one, correspond to revision one, revision two, and revision three, respectively.The more granular information, covering bits four through zero, provides a specific identifier for the reference raw card itself. This field is utilized when bit 7 is set to zero, indicating the use of a standard reference raw card. The JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, an industry standards organization, defines a specific enumeration for these reference raw cards, tailored to various DIMM topologies. The particular characteristics of the DIMM, such as the number of ranks, the component data width (represented as x4, x8, or x16), the presence of error correction code, or ECC, and other design attributes, are analyzed to determine the appropriate reference raw card. This analysis results in a unique JEDEC Reference Raw Card number, which is then stored in this field within the SPD data.For instance, when bit seven is zero, and bits four through zero are binary zero zero zero zero zero, it signifies Reference Raw Card A. Similarly, binary zero zero zero zero one corresponds to Reference Raw Card B, zero zero zero one zero maps to Reference Raw Card C, zero zero zero one one indicates Reference Raw Card D, and zero zero one zero zero identifies Reference Raw Card E. Progressing further, binary zero zero one zero one corresponds to Reference Raw Card F, zero zero one one zero maps to Reference Raw Card G, and zero zero one one one indicates Reference Raw Card H.Continuing with this systematic encoding, zero one zero zero zero is associated with Reference Raw Card J, zero one zero zero one corresponds to Reference Raw Card K, zero one zero one zero maps to Reference Raw Card L, and zero one zero one one indicates Reference Raw Card M. The sequence extends with zero one one zero zero representing Reference Raw Card N, zero one one zero one corresponding to Reference Raw Card P, zero one one one zero mapping to Reference Raw Card R, and zero one one one one indicating Reference Raw Card T.Further along the encoding spectrum, one zero zero zero zero identifies Reference Raw Card U, one zero zero zero one corresponds to Reference Raw Card V, one zero zero one zero maps to Reference Raw Card W, and one zero zero one one indicates Reference Raw Card Y. The enumeration continues with one zero one zero zero representing Reference Raw Card AA, one zero one zero one corresponding to Reference Raw Card AB, and one zero one one zero mapping to Reference Raw Card AC.This systematic encoding ensures that the precise hardware configuration used during development can be accurately communicated and understood by the system's firmware or operating system, facilitating correct module initialization and operation. The structure represents a fundamental encoding and decoding scheme often employed in digital systems for identification, addressing, or configuration purposes, where discrete binary patterns correspond to specific states or entities within the memory module's design framework.
