The system's boot process is a complex sequence of events that can be affected by various exceptions and configuration settings. When a "no reset is needed" condition is met, the boot process continues, and any logging of the event occurs. However, certain exceptions, such as Type 3 and Type 4 Exceptions, require an interruption of the current boot flow and a system reset. A Type 3 Exception leads to a full boot, without the B O O T underscore M I N I M A L underscore C O N F I G U R A T I O N flag, to handle the exception, whereas a Type 4 Exception results in the B I O S entering Full Boot mode and performing Memory Initialization to complete the training.These exceptions are categorized in Table 11.3, which lists various types of exceptions and their corresponding examples. The table structure implies a classification of boot exceptions, where the exception type dictates the subsequent boot behavior. The diversity of examples highlights the complex interplay of hardware and software states that can lead to a deviation from the normal boot path, requiring these exception handling routines. The observation that these classifications "can be different, depending on the policy decisions of the designer" underscores the customizable nature of boot firmware and system initialization logic.To enable Intel Fast Boot functionality, certain baseline assumptions must be met. These assumptions include a stable platform configuration, where only minor modifications to the platform's hardware or software are permitted after the initial system provisioning and boot. The boot device list should not change, and non-P C I devices on external buses or ports should not require B I O S discovery and initialization. Additionally, device initialization needs should remain constant, and a minimum configuration boot should be used when the boot target is a nonstandard or user-defined O S.The Fast Boot feature also assumes that no U E F I shell or Serial Redirecting debug console is active during the boot process, as these interfaces could introduce user interaction or configuration changes that would negate the benefits of Fast Boot. Furthermore, a U E F I only boot is recommended, as legacy boot mechanisms can delay boot times and open the system to potential root kit attacks. The Setup Menu or other user entry during boot is not required, and when referring to sub-two-second timing, the start and finish lines are defined as the point when the processor comes out of reset and starts to fetch code from the S P I, and when the U E F I B I O S calls LoadImage() for the O S loader image, respectively.In the context of Intel Fast Boot Timing Results, the start line is when the processor comes out of reset and starts to fetch code from the S P I, while the finish line is when the U E F I B I O S calls LoadImage() for the O S loader image. The system enters a handoff phase where the O S loader is responsible much more so than the B I O S. The timing results are critical in evaluating the performance of the Fast Boot feature, which aims to minimize the time it takes for the system to boot up and become operational. By understanding the various exceptions, configuration settings, and timing metrics involved in the boot process, developers and system administrators can optimize the boot sequence to achieve faster boot times and improved system performance.
