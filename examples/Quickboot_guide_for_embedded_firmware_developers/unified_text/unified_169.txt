The S P D field zero hexadecimal one six, denoted as Min. Active to Precharge Delay, is a critical parameter that must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor. In the provided example, the t R A S value found in the Micron M T four one J two five six M eight dash one eight seven E datasheet for the specific S D R A M chip gives thirty seven point five nanoseconds. This number must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which has a value of zero point one two five nanoseconds, represented in hexadecimal as zero hexadecimal B. The calculation yields three hundred, which is then converted into hexadecimal format, resulting in hexadecimal one two C. The L S B part of the t R A S, which is the lower four bits of the thirty seven point five nanoseconds value after scaling, is stored in S P D field twenty two, or S P D field zero hexadecimal one six. The corresponding hexadecimal value for this field is shown as zero hexadecimal two C. The M S B part of the t R A S, representing the higher order bits of the scaled value, is stored in S P D field twenty one, or S P D field zero hexadecimal one five. Specifically, the lower nibble of this M S B value, which is zero hexadecimal zero one, is placed into bits three through zero of S P D field twenty one. The table presented summarizes this information, mapping the decimal byte address twenty two, the hexadecimal address zero hexadecimal one six, to the field name "Minimum Active to Precharge Delay (t R A S min) L S B". It also shows the typical value associated with this field as zero hexadecimal two C and provides the definition as thirty seven point five nanoseconds. The lower nibble of Byte twenty one and the contents of Byte twenty two combined create a twelve bit value that defines the minimum S D R A M Active to Precharge Delay Time in Medium Timebase units. The most significant bit is Bit three of Byte twenty one, and the least significant bit is Bit zero of Byte twenty two. This twelve bit value is crucial for memory timing and is sourced from the D D R three S D R A M datasheet, with values ranging from one to four thousand ninety five. The example table further illustrates this concept by showing specific instances of t R A S values in Medium Timebase units, their corresponding nanosecond durations, and their typical use cases. For instance, a t R A S value of three hundred, specified in Medium Timebase units, represented as zero x one two C in hexadecimal, translates to zero point one two five nanoseconds for the Medium Timebase unit, resulting in a t R A S of thirty seven point five nanoseconds. This particular timing configuration is associated with D D R three dash eight hundred D memory. Other examples in the table show similar correlations between the encoded t R A S value, the timebase duration, and the actual latency in nanoseconds, which is critical for system initialization and proper memory operation. The definition of the t R A S parameter is fundamental in the memory controller's task of managing the state transitions within the S D R A M modules, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance. The table from the J E D E C D D R three S P D specification provides a comprehensive list of t R A S values in M T B units, along with their corresponding M T B durations in nanoseconds, t R A S results in nanoseconds, and their intended use cases for various D D R three memory modules. Each row in the table represents a specific t R A S value, such as three hundred, two hundred eighty eight, two hundred eighty, two hundred seventy two, and two hundred sixty four, along with their respective M T B durations and t R A S results. These values are crucial for configuring and optimizing memory performance in systems that utilize D D R three S D R A M. The information provided in the table enables system designers and engineers to select the appropriate t R A S values for their specific memory modules, ensuring reliable and efficient operation. In conclusion, the S P D field zero hexadecimal one six plays a vital role in defining the minimum Active to Precharge Delay Time for S D R A M modules. The process of extracting and scaling the t R A S value, as well as storing it in the S P D fields, is critical for ensuring proper memory timing and performance. The examples and tables provided illustrate the importance of this parameter and its correlation with various D D R three memory modules, highlighting the need for precise configuration and optimization to achieve optimal system performance.
