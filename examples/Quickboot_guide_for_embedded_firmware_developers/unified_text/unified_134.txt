The provided text delves into performance considerations within a computing system, specifically focusing on storage device access times, Universal Serial Bus, or U S B, latency, and power management, culminating in a discussion on security and its impact on boot speeds. Regarding storage, the text contrasts the behavior of Hard Disk Drives, or H D D s, with Solid State Drives, or S S D s. It highlights that unlike an H D D, which requires a mechanical spin-up period before data access is possible, the driver for an S S D does not enforce such a wait. This is because S S D s offer immediate data availability. The performance gap is quantified by noting that the fastest H D D s, at the time of writing, exhibit a power-up to data availability time of approximately one point four to three seconds, which is significantly slower, by roughly eight hundred milliseconds, compared to the instant availability on an Intel S S D X twenty-five M. This illustrates a fundamental difference in access latency driven by the underlying storage technology: mechanical versus solid state.The discussion then shifts to minimizing U S B latency. It points out that integrated U S B host controllers and hubs, as found in Intel platforms, tend to have much smaller latencies than generic host controllers and hubs. The Universal Serial Bus, or U S B, Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, plays a crucial role here, as it can be optimized for integrated components. This optimization involves leveraging specific U S B specification timings, as documented in the P C H U S B B I O S writer's guide. As an example, the minimum time required to enumerate all U S B ports, which occurs when devices are connected and their presence is detected, is approximately four hundred fifty milliseconds for a P C H. Utilizing Intel P C H silicon-specific timing guidelines can reduce this by more than half, demonstrating the impact of hardware-specific tuning on interface performance.The document then transitions to the broader topic of Power Management. It introduces the concept of Active State Power Management, or A S P M, which is a critical factor in extending battery life during runtime. The text mentions that A S P M is recommended for active state power management on several buses within the platform. While A S P M is important for energy conservation, it is acknowledged that there is a non-zero latency associated with entering and exiting the A S P M state, implying a trade-off between power savings and responsiveness. This highlights a common challenge in power management design: balancing energy efficiency with system performance and immediate availability.The Intel D M I bus, which facilitates communication between the C P U and platform controllers, supports Active State Power Management, or A S P M, as a mechanism for reducing power consumption. This A S P M implementation aims to minimize power draw by enabling lower link power states, such as L zero and L one, when the bus is idle. The potential benefits of this power management strategy, particularly its impact on system responsiveness during boot and resume phases, are explored. The timing of enabling D M I A S P M within the B I O S initialization flow is critical to avoid adverse effects. Specifically, the text discusses three potential points in the boot process for configuring these D M I A S P M link states: first, at the exit boot services phase, which marks the transition from the boot environment to the operating system; second, within the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, or A C P I, framework; and third, through a one-shot S M I timer, heuristically set to approximately eight seconds after the exit boot services call, to ensure compatibility with the operating system booting period.Table twelve point two, titled "Active State Power Management Impact," presents a comparative analysis of system responsiveness measured in seconds across different phases of operation, contrasting a baseline configuration with D M I A S P M enabled in the "on" state versus when it is "off." The metrics include B I O S Post time, which is the duration from power-on until the basic input output system completes its self-tests and hands over control to the operating system; Boot to Desktop time, representing the interval from power-on to when the graphical user interface is available; Boot Complete time, indicating the full initialization of the operating system and its essential services; and Resume time, which measures the system's responsiveness when transitioning from a sleep state. Analyzing the data in Table twelve point two, we observe that when D M I A S P M is "on," the B I O S Post time is eight point eight nine seconds, negligibly different from the baseline of eight point eight seven seconds. The Boot to Desktop time shows a reduction from five point three nine seconds in the baseline to five point one four seconds with A S P M "on," indicating a slight improvement in responsiveness during O S loading. Similarly, Boot Complete time decreases from seven point three one seconds to six point nine seven seconds, suggesting faster overall operating system initialization. The most significant impact is seen in Resume time, which drops from zero point six seconds to zero point five seven seconds when A S P M is enabled. These figures collectively suggest that while D M I A S P M has a minimal impact on the initial B I O S stages, it offers tangible benefits in accelerating operating system boot and, notably, the resume process from a low power state, thereby enhancing overall system efficiency.Security at a high level is often a trade-off versus boot speeds and responsiveness. Trusted Platform Modules and measured boots will add noticeable time to a boot flow. Single-threaded Boot ROMs, H W Root of Trust, and subsequent daisy chaining of authentication takes a very long time if not architected for speed and security. You need to look at the platform requirements carefully and balance security and responsiveness. There are some things we can do to mitigate security impact to platform boot times. Intel Trusted Execution Technology, or Intel T X T, included additional B I O S binary modules that execute to assist in authentication of subsequent code execution and provide a secure environment for that activity. It takes time to execute these modules, and it takes a small amount of time to do authentication prior to executing code in these environments. Other authentication schemes have similar setup and execution penalties. Trusted platform modules hash and save results as variables during a secure or measured boot. The delay associated with a T P M can be between three hundred milliseconds to upwards of one second, depending on the T P M vendor, the T P M firmware revision, and the size of the B I O S firmware volumes being hashed. There are several techniques that can save time when using a T P M.
