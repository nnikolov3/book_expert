The discussion centers on the crucial aspect of optimizing system startup times, particularly for embedded systems where immediate responsiveness is a key user expectation. Unlike traditional personal computers, which might tolerate a more pronounced boot sequence, modern consumer devices, such as tablets, are expected to transition from a powered-off or low power state to full operational readiness with minimal delay. This demand for rapid "turn-on" or "wake" times influences how system firmware and bootloaders are designed. The current paradigm suggests a shift from traditional, lengthy boot processes involving extensive checks like Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, and Power On Self Test, or P O S T, to more streamlined and innovative approaches.To achieve faster boot times, it is essential to understand and optimize various stages of the system initialization. This includes the fundamental architecture of how the system transitions from a quiescent state to an active one, often involving firmware that prepares the hardware for the operating system. The goal is to reduce the overhead associated with these initialization phases, ensuring that the system is not only functional but also highly responsive to user input from the moment it is powered on. Several technical strategies can be applied to achieve this, including platform policy rethink, turning off debugging, decreasing flash size, reordering flash image, caching as Ram pre-memory during the Pre-EFI Initialization phase, and enabling Intel SpeedStep technology early.Platform policy rethink implies a re-evaluation of the default configurations and priorities within the system's firmware, suggesting that existing policies might be too conservative or include unnecessary checks that prolong the boot process. A revised policy could prioritize essential initialization steps and defer or eliminate less critical operations during the initial startup sequence. Turning off debugging features, which are invaluable during development but introduce significant overhead during runtime, is a straightforward method to reduce the amount of code executed and data processed, thereby accelerating the boot process. Decreasing flash size, either by reducing the size of the flash storage or optimizing the firmware image to occupy less space, can lead to faster read operations and a quicker transfer of necessary code into memory.Reordering flash image carefully can also affect boot performance by allowing the system to access essential components more quickly, potentially reducing the number of I/O operations or improving the locality of reference for the processor. Utilizing the system's Ram as a cache during the Pre-EFI Initialization phase leverages the speed differential between Ram and other storage media like flash memory, ensuring that frequently accessed data or code segments from slower storage can be loaded into the faster Ram for quicker retrieval. Enabling Intel SpeedStep technology early in the boot process allows the system to manage power consumption and performance more efficiently from the outset, potentially contributing to a smoother and faster overall startup.Additional optimizations include Boot Device Selection, or B D S, optimization, which determines the order in which storage devices are checked for a bootable operating system, directly impacting system startup performance. Enhancing platform memory speed is also crucial, as it affects the efficiency of memory access, a critical factor in overall system responsiveness. Removing legacy components and functionalities, such as PS/2 keyboard/mouse support, BIOS setup, video option ROM, and BIOS USB functional support, can streamline the firmware by eliminating non-essential or redundant configuration interfaces and initialization routines.The transition to modern booting standards, such as Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I, offers features like graphical interfaces, network booting, and support for larger hard drives. Using U E F I drivers instead of option ROMs and leveraging U E F I services promotes interoperability and a consistent pre-operating system environment. Removing unnecessary setup menus and using solid-state drives instead of hard disk drives can further accelerate boot times by eliminating spin-up time and reducing the time it takes to load the operating system.The concept of platform policy is fundamental in system design, involving the ability to limit the number of variables and simplify configuration to enhance predictability and control over the system's behavior. This principle aligns with robust system engineering, where reducing complexity and managing potential configuration issues are paramount for stability and maintainability. By understanding the "what" and the "why" behind system design, developers can institute changes, question traditional approaches, and make informed decisions about component usage and initialization.In determining what is necessary to do in the B I O S space versus the operating system space, it is often more important to identify what can be skipped or deferred to reduce boot time. For instance, if the operating system kernel or drivers will repeat the bus/device enumeration of the entire P C I subsystem, it may be unnecessary for the B I O S to perform these checks, allowing for a more streamlined boot process. By focusing on what is truly necessary for system initialization and leveraging modern technologies and design principles, developers can create systems that meet the demand for rapid responsiveness and efficient operation.
