The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, specification is a crucial mechanism for how system memory modules, specifically D R A M, communicate their capabilities and characteristics to the host system's motherboard and central processing unit, or C P U. This communication is fundamental for system initialization and proper memory configuration, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.The S P D specification includes various fields that provide detailed information about the memory module. For instance, S P D Field number thirty two pertains to the "Module Thermal Sensor" definition within the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification. This field describes the module's supported thermal sensor capabilities, including whether a thermal sensor is incorporated onto the assembly and the accuracy of the thermal sensor.Another important field is S P D Field zero times twenty one, which defines the "S D R A M Device Type." The field at byte address thirty three is dedicated to this classification, with a typical value of hexadecimal zero zero representing a "Normal D R A M" device. The subsequent breakdown of Byte thirty three further elucidates the "S D R A M Device Type" field, which is structured into distinct bit fields conveying specific information about the memory device.The bit fields within Byte thirty three include the S D R A M Device Type, Die Count, and Signal Loading two. The S D R A M Device Type is indicated by bit seven, where a value of zero represents a "Standard Monolithic D R A M Device," and a value of one signifies a "Non Standard Device." The Die Count is represented by bits six through four, employing a three bit encoding scheme to specify the number of dies on the module, ranging from "Not specified" to "eight die."In addition to these fields, the S P D specification also includes reserved fields, such as S P D Field zero times twenty two through zero times thirty three, which are designated as "Reserved" and should be set to hexadecimal zero zero for J E D E C S P D Specification v one point zero. However, for J E D E C S P D Specification v one point one, some of these fields are defined, including Byte thirty four, Fine Offset for S D R A M Minimum Cycle Time, t C K min, and Byte thirty five, Fine Offset for Minimum C A S Latency Time, t A A min.These bytes modify the calculation of specific S P D bytes, such as Byte twelve and Byte sixteen, using fine corrections with F T B units. The values of t C K min and t A A min come from the S D R A M datasheet and are represented as Two's Complement multipliers for F T B units, ranging from plus one hundred twenty seven to minus one hundred twenty eight.The Mode Register two, or M R two, is another crucial component within the address bus structure of a D D R S D R A M context. This register is configured through an address bus, with specific bits influencing its operational parameters. The configuration of M R two involves setting specific bits to control various functions, such as the mode register set selection, C A S Write Latency, Self Refresh Temperature, and Dynamic O D T.The mode register set selection is controlled by bits M sixteen and M fifteen, which select different mode register sets, including M R zero, M R one, M R two, and M R three. The C A S Write Latency is controlled by bits M ten and M nine, which specify different latency values, such as five C K and six C K, with specific constraints on the clock cycle duration.The Self Refresh Temperature is controlled by bit M seven, which specifies the temperature range for self refresh, including "Normal" and "Extended" temperature ranges. The Dynamic O D T is controlled by bits M eight and M nine, which specify different termination resistance ratios, such as R T T nom disabled and R Z Q divided by four.In terms of extended temperature usage, Micron's D D R three S D R A M supports an optional extended temperature range of zero degrees Celsius to plus ninety five degrees Celsius. Thus, the S R T and A S R options must be used at a minimum to ensure reliable performance and thermal management within this extended temperature range.The S P D Field thirty one, "S D R A M Thermal and Refresh Options," provides information about the thermal and refresh configurations of the memory module. This field is part of the S P D data structure and contains specific bits that control various thermal and refresh options, including the thermal sensor and self refresh temperature.In conclusion, the S P D specification and the Mode Register two are essential components of a D D R S D R A M system, providing critical information about the memory module's capabilities and characteristics. The various fields and bits within the S P D specification and the Mode Register two work together to ensure proper memory configuration, compatibility, and optimal performance, while also providing features such as thermal management and self refresh.
