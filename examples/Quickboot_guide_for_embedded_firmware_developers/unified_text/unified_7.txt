The value of a system's Basic Input/Output System, or B I O S, can significantly impact the overall bill of materials, or B O M, cost, varying greatly from one product segment to another. This variability is influenced by a multitude of factors, including the business model, which often combines non-recurrent engineering, or N R E, charges with per-unit royalties. The N R E costs encompass the one-time expenses associated with designing, developing, and testing the B I O S for a specific hardware platform, while royalties represent a recurring licensing fee paid per motherboard or system unit shipped.Several critical factors dictate the specific N R E and royalty structure. Firstly, original innovation plays a significant role, as the development of novel features, optimized boot sequences, or unique security protocols can substantially increase the cost. Secondly, porting costs are a major consideration, as adapting an existing B I O S to a new hardware platform requires substantial engineering effort to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. The degree of source-level access also profoundly impacts the B I O S valuation, as providing the licensee with complete source code enables extensive customization but often comes at a higher premium due to the transfer of valuable intellectual property.Support needs, expected volume, customization requirements, and vendor or supplier history are additional factors that influence the total cost of ownership. In high-volume scenarios, royalties per board can constitute a relatively low percentage of the B O M cost, whereas in limited production volumes, the N R E and per-unit royalty costs can disproportionately increase the B O M. Embedded systems, in particular, often demand a higher cost per board for their B I O S solution due to the diverse and highly specific nature of these applications, limited production volumes, and the necessity for a high-touch, collaborative model to adapt mainstream B I O S architectures to unique hardware configurations and custom operational requirements.Historically, the development of low-level firmware was a distinguishing characteristic of computer manufacturers. Companies like I B M, Compaq, and H P have developed their own proprietary boot firmware, allowing them to maintain control over the initial system bootstrapping process and ensure compatibility with their chosen operating systems. The choice between developing firmware internally or sourcing it externally is a recurring dilemma in system design, balancing cost, intellectual property control, and the degree of customization required for a unique product offering.In the contemporary computing environment, manufacturers continue to engage in B I O S development, often adopting a hybrid model where they develop their core B I O S while leveraging specialized B I O S vendors for certain product lines or functionalities. The shift from legacy B I O S to the more modern Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I, represents a significant architectural advancement, providing a more extensible, modular, and feature-rich environment. Intel's involvement in maintaining U E F I solutions underscores the industry's move towards more open and collaborative firmware development paradigms.Server manufacturers, in particular, have extensive value-add firmware-based solutions for baseboard management controllers, or B M Cs, which are embedded controllers that control the back-end subsystem to enhance a server board's ability to be remotely managed and increase fault tolerance. The B M C's core function is to facilitate out-of-band management of the server, enabling administrators to monitor and control the server's back-end subsystem even if the main C P U is powered off or unresponsive.The decision to make or buy boot firmware is complex, especially for Original Equipment Manufacturers operating in the embedded systems space. Boot firmware has a profound impact on system functionality, reliability, and security, and its development demands highly specialized expertise. Companies must weigh the costs and benefits of implementing a commercial B I O S product, reusing or borrowing from open-source solutions, or developing their own firmware from scratch. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice ultimately depends on factors such as the level of experience, the number of designs to support, and the desired level of customization and control.In the education arena, students of software engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering learn low-level firmware coding as part of their curriculum, but most do not get to develop their own solutions from scratch. Except for some graduate-level projects, the full experience of system firmware development is often not covered in academic programs. As a result, companies must carefully consider their options and make an informed decision about whether to use a B I O S vendor, reuse or borrow from open-source solutions, or develop their own firmware from scratch. This decision will have a significant impact on the overall cost, performance, and reliability of their products.
