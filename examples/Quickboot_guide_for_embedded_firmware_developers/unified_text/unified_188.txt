The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard plays a crucial role in the configuration and operation of dynamic random access memory, or D Ram, modules within modern computer systems. This standard utilizes a small storage device, typically an EEPROM, located on memory modules such as D Ram DIMMs, to provide essential parameters that enable system firmware, including the Basic Input/Output System, or B I O S, and U E F I, to properly configure memory operations.A key aspect of this configuration involves S P D Field number sixty three, which defines "Address Mapping from Edge Connector to D Ram." This field specifies how logical addresses generated by the memory controller are translated to physical connections on the D Ram chips through the module's edge connector. The mapping can be configured as either standard or mirrored, with Bit zero controlling this selection where zero represents standard mapping and one indicates mirrored mapping. In standard configuration, address signals maintain direct correspondence between edge connector and D Ram pins, while mirrored mapping introduces specific permutations where certain address lines are swapped. For instance, A three on the edge connector maps to A four on the D Ram, and A four maps to A three, with similar pairings occurring for A five and A six, as well as A seven and A eight. This remapping extends to bank address signals as well, where B A zero and B A one are interchanged in mirrored configurations. These variations in signal routing are implemented to optimize signal integrity and facilitate memory interleaving schemes that enhance data throughput through concurrent memory access capabilities.The specification designates S P D Field zero through forty through seventy four as reserved space, following common hardware standardization practices where such fields are set aside for future use or committee-defined purposes. These reserved bytes, spanning from sixty four to one hundred sixteen in decimal representation, are initialized to hexadecimal zero zero to ensure backward compatibility and prevent unintended behavior that might result from uninitialized or random data within these fields.Critical identification information is stored in S P D Fields one hundred seventeen and one hundred eighteen, which together encode the Module Manufacturer I D Code. This two-byte field serves essential functions in system configuration, with byte one hundred seventeen containing the Least Significant Byte and byte one hundred eighteen holding the Most Significant Byte. The encoding follows J E D E C specification J E P one hundred six, which provides standardized methods for representing manufacturer identifiers. The structure involves multiple bytes where the first byte indicates the number of continuation codes, while the second byte contains the last nonzero byte of the manufacturer's identification code. For example, Micron Technology is assigned the code hexadecimal eight zero two C, with byte one hundred seventeen set to hexadecimal two C and byte one hundred eighteen containing hexadecimal eight zero. Similar encoding schemes apply to other manufacturers such as Fujitsu, which uses hexadecimal zero four in byte one hundred eighteen and hexadecimal eight zero in byte one hundred seventeen, and U S Modular, which employs hexadecimal A eight in byte one hundred eighteen and hexadecimal zero four in byte one hundred seventeen.Byte one hundred nineteen, designated as S P D Field hexadecimal seventy seven, contains the Module Manufacturer Location information. This byte provides a unique identifier for the manufacturing facility where the memory module was produced. While the S P D specification does not include a comprehensive decode table for all manufacturing sites, individual manufacturers maintain their own tracking systems and appropriate decoding mechanisms for interpreting these location identifiers.The manufacturing timeline is documented through S P D Fields hexadecimal seventy eight and hexadecimal seventy nine, which encode the Module Manufacturing Date. These fields provide temporal context for when the memory module was produced, offering valuable information for inventory management, warranty tracking, and quality control purposes within system maintenance and procurement processes.
