The Intel 5100 MCH Chipset is a crucial component in the Intel 5100 platform, responsible for managing the flow of data between the central processing unit, or C P U, and the memory modules. To facilitate this, the chipset must be properly connected to the Dual In-Line Memory Modules, or D I M Ms, through a specific pin mapping configuration. This configuration is detailed in the Intel 5100 Platform Design Guide, which provides a comprehensive overview of the platform's architecture and design considerations.Figure 37 illustrates the clock and control signal pin mapping for a single D I M M configuration, where one D I M M is connected per channel, operating in a thirty-two gigabyte mode, with a Quad-rank configuration, and including S three support. The diagram shows the signal lines originating from the Intel 5100 MCH Chipset and terminating at the D I M M, with specific pin assignments for clock and control signals. The signals include D C L K P and D C L K N, which are differential clock signals, O D T signals for On Die Termination, C S signals for Chip Select, and C K E signals for Clock Enable.The D C L K P and D C L K N signals are connected to pins one hundred eighty-five and one hundred eighty-six on the D I M M, respectively. The O D T signals are routed to pins one hundred ninety-five and seventy-seven, while the C S signals are mapped to pins one hundred ninety-three, seventy-six, two hundred twenty, and two hundred twenty-one. The C K E signals are connected to pins fifty-two and one hundred seventy-one. These mappings are in accordance with the J E D E C standards for D D R two two hundred forty pin Registered D I M M Pinouts, ensuring interoperability between different memory components and systems.In addition to the single D I M M configuration, Figure 38 illustrates the clock and control signal pin mapping for a dual D I M M configuration, where two D I M Ms are connected per channel, operating in a thirty-two gigabyte mode. The diagram shows the signal lines originating from the Intel 5100 MCH Chipset and terminating at the two D I M Ms, with specific pin assignments for clock and control signals. The signals include D C L K P, D C L K N, O D T, C S, and C K E, which are similar to those in the single D I M M configuration.The D C L K P and D C L K N signals are connected to pins one hundred eighty-five and one hundred eighty-six on both D I M Ms, respectively. The O D T signals are routed to pins one hundred ninety-five and seventy-seven on both D I M Ms, while the C S signals are mapped to pins one hundred ninety-three and seventy-six on both D I M Ms. The C K E signals are connected to pins fifty-two and one hundred seventy-one on both D I M Ms. These consistent mappings suggest a symmetrical termination strategy and a shared clock enable mechanism across the D I M Ms.The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure is also an essential component in the Intel 5100 platform, providing critical information about the D Ram module's capabilities and configuration. Field Zero x zero eight, or the Module Bus Width field, is a specific field within the S P D data structure that describes the width of the S D R A M memory bus on the module. This field is set to zero times zero B, seventy-two bits, if the design is implementing Error-Correcting Code, or E C C, and zero times zero three h otherwise.The Module Bus Width field is encoded in a single byte, with bits two through zero representing the primary bus width and bits four through three representing the bus extensions, such as parity or E C C. The field can be set to various values, including sixty-four bits for the primary bus width, with or without E C C. For example, a sixty-four bit primary bus with no parity or E C C would be represented by the value x x x zero zero zero zero one one, while a sixty-four bit primary bus with eight bit E C C would be represented by the value x x x zero zero one zero one one. This information is crucial for the system to understand the data transfer capabilities of the D Ram module and to configure the memory subsystem accordingly.
