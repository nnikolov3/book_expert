The intricacies of SDRAM timing parameters are crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer between the C P U and memory modules. A key parameter in this context is the "Internal Write to Read Delay Time," denoted as t W T R, which influences the efficiency of read operations following write operations. The value of t W T R is often specified in terms of clock cycles and can be found in the SDRAM datasheet, with its exact timing dependent on the SDRAM's page size and operating frequency.To accurately determine the t W T R value, one must refer to the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure, which contains the "Minimum Internal Write to Read Command Delay Time" (t W T R min) in S P D Field Number twenty six, as defined by the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification. This field is encoded using bits seven through zero, with values ranging from one to two hundred fifty five. For instance, a value of sixty in "t W T R (M T B units)" corresponds to a "Timebase (ns)" of zero point one two five, resulting in a "t W T R Result (ns)" of seven point five, a characteristic associated with all D D R three S D R A M speed bins.Furthermore, the timing specifications for different D D R three memory speeds, including D D R three eight hundred, D D R three ten sixty six, D D R three thirteen thirty three, and D D R three sixteen hundred, are detailed in a comprehensive table. This table outlines various parameters such as the D Q S, D Q S number differential READ postamble, D L L locking time, and C T R L, C M D, A D D R setup times, all of which are critical for ensuring proper memory operation. The minimum and maximum values for these parameters are provided in clock cycles or picoseconds, highlighting the importance of precise timing in high-speed memory interfaces.The "Minimum C T R L, C M D, A D D R pulse width" is another vital parameter, with values such as nine hundred picoseconds for D D R three eight hundred, seven hundred eighty picoseconds for D D R three ten sixty six, six hundred twenty picoseconds for D D R three thirteen thirty three, and five hundred sixty picoseconds for D D R three sixteen hundred. These pulse widths ensure that control signals are sufficiently long to be reliably recognized by the memory interface.In addition to these parameters, the table references "Speed Bin Tables" for specific timings like t R C D, t R P, and t R A S, which are fundamental to D R A M operation. The t R C D, or Row Address to Column Address Delay, t R P, or Row Precharge time, and t R A S, or Row Active time, define the time between activating a row and accessing columns within that row, and the time required to precharge a row before activating a new one.Other critical parameters include the "Write recovery time" (t W R), "Delay from start of internal WRITE transaction to internal READ command" (t W T R), "READ to PRECHARGE time" (t R T P), and "C A S to C A S command delay" (t C C D). These timings are essential for managing the refresh and row activation cycles in D R A M, directly impacting memory bandwidth and latency. For example, the minimum "Write recovery time" is fifteen nanoseconds for all D D R three speeds, while the "Delay from start of internal WRITE transaction to internal READ command" is greater than or equal to four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds.The "Auto precharge write recovery plus precharge time" (t D A L) and the "MODE REGISTER SET command cycle time" (t M R D) are also specified, contributing to the overall operational efficiency and stability of the memory system. These parameters collectively define the intricate dance of signals and timing that governs high-speed memory operation, underscoring the need for precise control and synchronization in memory interfaces.In the context of S P D fields, the "Minimum Read to Precharge Command Delay" (t R T P min) is another important parameter, found in S P D Field zero times one B. This value must be extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor to obtain the correct timing. For instance, a t R T P value of seven point five nanoseconds, when divided by a Medium Timebase Divisor of zero point one two five nanoseconds, yields a value of sixty, which is zero times three C in hexadecimal.The provided information highlights the complexity and nuance of SDRAM timing parameters, emphasizing the importance of careful consideration and calculation to ensure reliable and efficient memory operation. By understanding and applying these parameters, system designers can optimize memory performance, minimize latency, and maximize bandwidth, ultimately leading to improved overall system efficiency and reliability.
