The timing parameters for Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D Ram, are detailed across different speed grades, including D Ram three hundred eighty, D Ram one thousand sixty six, D Ram one thousand three hundred thirty three, and D Ram one thousand six hundred. Each parameter is quantified by its minimum and maximum allowable values, often expressed in units of clock cycles, or C K, or picoseconds, P S. The D Q S, D Q S sharp differential Read postamble parameter has a minimum value of zero point three C K across all listed D Ram speeds, with a maximum value noted as twenty seven for D Ram three hundred eighty and D Ram one thousand six hundred.The D L L locking time shows a consistent minimum of five hundred twelve C K across all speeds, indicating a fixed requirement for the Delay Locked Loop to stabilize. Command and address setup times, such as the setup time for Control, Command, And Address signals to the clock, C K sharp, exhibit variations. For example, the setup time for C T R L, C M D, A D D R is represented by I S, with a minimum of two hundred picoseconds for D Ram three hundred eighty, reducing to sixty five picoseconds for D Ram one thousand three hundred thirty three and D Ram one thousand six hundred.The table also specifies command periods and intervals, such as the Precharge command period, denoted by R P, and the Activate to Precharge command period, symbolized by R A S. These timings are described as being further detailed in supplementary tables, likely related to specific performance bins or configurations within each D Ram speed grade. The Activate to Activate command period, further broken down by page size, demonstrates how memory organization impacts timing. For a one K B page size, the minimum Activate to Activate command period is governed by the greater of four C K or ten nanoseconds for D Ram three hundred eighty and D Ram one thousand sixty six.For D Ram one thousand three hundred thirty three and D Ram one thousand six hundred, this minimum is the greater of four C K or six nanoseconds for the one K B page size, and remains the greater of four C K or ten nanoseconds for the two K B page size. The concept of "windows" in memory operations refers to the time intervals during which certain commands can be issued relative to others, influencing data throughput and system responsiveness. The table shows "Four Activate windows" with specified timings for one K B and two K B page sizes, further illustrating the complex interplay between command sequencing, page management, and overall memory performance.The Write recovery time, symbolized by W R, defines the minimum time required after a write operation before another write operation can commence. This parameter is critical for ensuring data integrity and proper operation of the memory controller. The table indicates a minimum write recovery time of fifteen nanoseconds for all speed grades, with the maximum being not applicable. This consistent minimum value suggests a fundamental requirement for data stabilization within the memory cells, independent of the clock speed within this range.In addition to these timing parameters, the document also presents addressing configurations for different memory sizes, including 512 Meg by four, 256 Meg by eight, and 128 Meg by sixteen. The Configuration parameter varies accordingly, with sixty four Meg by four by eight banks for the 512 Meg by four configuration, thirty two Meg by eight by eight banks for the 256 Meg by eight configuration, and sixteen Meg by sixteen by eight banks for the 128 Meg by sixteen configuration. The Refresh count is consistent across all configurations at eight K.Row addressing, Bank addressing, and Column addressing also vary by configuration. For example, the 512 Meg by four configuration has thirty two K row addressing, eight Bank addressing, and two K column addressing. The 256 Meg by eight configuration has similar row and Bank addressing, but one K column addressing. The 128 Meg by sixteen configuration has sixteen K row addressing, eight Bank addressing, and one K column addressing.The S P D Field twenty nine, Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time, t F A W min L S B, is also discussed, with an example from the Micron M T four one two five six M eight Datasheet. Furthermore, the S P D Field zero X one E, S D R A M Optional Features, indicates that the S D R A M device supports features such as R Z Q slash seven, R Z Q slash six, and D L L Off Mode Support, as shown in the example from the M T four one two five six M eight datasheet.The Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time, or t F A W, is a critical parameter that governs the minimum time interval between consecutive "Activate" commands within a specific four-bank group of D D R three memory. The t F A W values vary across different D D R three memory speeds and page sizes, as illustrated in the provided tables. For instance, a t F A W of three hundred twenty micro-units with a Timebase of zero point one two five nanoseconds results in a t F A W Result of forty nanoseconds, used as an example for D D R three dash eight hundred with a one K B page size.Similarly, a t F A W of four hundred micro-units with a Timebase of zero point one two five nanoseconds results in a t F A W Result of fifty nanoseconds, used as an example for D D R three dash eight hundred with a two K B page size. These values are essential for memory controller operation and are defined by the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification. The data presented in the tables highlights the intricate interplay between memory controller design, memory module capabilities, and the electrical characteristics of the D D R three standard.Proper adherence to these timing parameters is essential for reliable memory operation, preventing data corruption and ensuring the integrity of memory accesses, especially at higher frequencies and denser memory configurations. The variation of t F A W with memory speed and page size underscores the importance of careful consideration of these factors in memory system design. By understanding and applying these timing parameters, system designers can optimize memory performance, ensure data integrity, and create reliable and efficient computing systems.
