The provided text and table detail the tRASmin parameter for DDR3 memory modules, specifically referencing SPD Field #22 from the JEDEC DDR3 SPD Specification. tRASmin denotes the minimum active to precharge delay time, a critical timing parameter that dictates the minimum duration a row must remain active before it can be precharged. This delay is crucial for ensuring data integrity and proper operation of the dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) cells.The table presents several data points correlating tRAS (in Memory Timing Base units) with the corresponding tRAS result in nanoseconds, and categorizes these by specific DDR3 module designations. For instance, the first row shows tRAS in M T B units as three hundred, M T B as zero point one two five nanoseconds, tRAS result as thirty seven point five nanoseconds, and the Use as D D R three dash one zero six six E. Similarly, the subsequent rows detail various tRAS values and their corresponding results for different DDR3 modules, including DDR3-1066F, DDR3-1066G, DDR3-1333F, DDR3-1333G, DDR3-1333H, and DDR3-1333J.As the tRAS units decrease, such as to two hundred eighty eight units, the tRASmin value also decreases, observed as thirty six nanoseconds for DDR3-1333F and G, and thirty six nanoseconds for DDR3-1333H and J. This trend continues for DDR3-1600 modules where a tRAS of two hundred eighty units results in thirty five nanoseconds tRASmin. Further down, for DDR3-1866 modules with two hundred seventy two units, the tRASmin is thirty four nanoseconds. Finally, for DDR3-2133 modules with two hundred sixty four units, the tRASmin is thirty three nanoseconds.The relationship between tRASmin and memory frequency is also highlighted. As memory frequencies increase, the period of each clock cycle shortens, allowing for a lower number of clock cycles to represent the same absolute time duration. Consequently, the absolute time for tRASmin also decreases with higher clock frequencies, provided the number of clock cycles remains consistent. The table illustrates how different memory speed bins, indicated by the DDR3 designations with appended letters, are associated with specific timing parameters, reflecting the performance and overclocking potential of these modules.In addition to the tRASmin parameter, the text also discusses other timing parameters for DDR3 memory modules, specifically focusing on two speed bins: DDR3-1066 speed bin with a CAS Latency, tRCD, and tRP of 7-7-7, and a similar bin with timings of 8-8-8. The data is presented in two tables, each delineating various timing parameters, their symbolic representation, minimum and maximum values in nanoseconds, and accompanying notes.The first table outlines fundamental command and data path timing, including the ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay time, denoted by tRCD, which is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds for the 7-7-7 bin and fifteen nanoseconds for the 8-8-8 bin. The table also details the PRECHARGE command period, tRP, with values of thirteen point one two five nanoseconds and fifteen nanoseconds, respectively. The ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE or Refresh command period, tRC, is fifty point six two five nanoseconds for the 7-7-7 bin and fifty two point five nanoseconds for the 8-8-8 bin. Lastly, the ACTIVATE to PRECHARGE command period, tRAS, is listed as thirty seven point five multiplied by tREFI for both bins, with a unit of nanoseconds and a note indicating that tREFI depends on the operating temperature.The second table elaborates on Command Latency (CL) and Column Write Latency (CWL) settings, presenting combinations of CL and CWL values and their corresponding CAS Write Latency (tCWL) in clock cycles, with associated minimum and maximum timing in nanoseconds and specific notes. For instance, a CL of 5 combined with CWL of 5 results in a tCWL of 3.0 to 3.3 nanoseconds for the 7-7-7 bin and 3.0 to 3.3 nanoseconds for the 8-8-8 bin. Several combinations, such as CL=6 with CWL=6, or CL=7, or CL=8 with CWL=5 or 6, are listed as "Reserved" for certain timing ranges, implying these configurations are not standard or validated for these specific speed bins.The supported CL settings across both bins are 5, 6, 7, and 8, and supported CWL settings are 5 and 6 for both speed bins, also in clock cycles. A crucial note here states that the CL and CWL settings directly influence the tCK (clock cycle time) requirements, implying a direct correlation between the latency settings and the operational frequency of the memory, where higher latencies might necessitate slower clock speeds for stable operation within the specified timing constraints. The dependency of tREFI on operating temperature is also highlighted, indicating that memory refresh intervals must be dynamically adjusted based on thermal conditions to maintain data integrity.Furthermore, the text explains the process of extracting and interpreting specific timing parameters from Serial Presence Detect (S P D) data, particularly concerning D Ram memory modules. This process is crucial for system initialization and proper memory controller configuration. The document references the need to fulfill 'C K', both 'C L' and 'C W L' requirement settings, and notes that reserved settings are not allowed, emphasizing the importance of adhering to defined standards for S P D fields to ensure interoperability and correct system behavior.The example from the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet illustrates the extraction of the tRC value, which is fifty point six two five nanoseconds, and its division by the Medium Timebase Divisor, zero point one two five nanoseconds, resulting in a value of four zero five, or zero hexadecimal one nine five. The L S B, zero hexadecimal nine five, is then placed into S P D field twenty three, zero hexadecimal one seven. This process demonstrates the importance of accurate timing parameter extraction and calculation for proper memory configuration and operation.In conclusion, the provided text and tables offer a comprehensive overview of the tRASmin parameter and other timing parameters for DDR3 memory modules, highlighting their significance in ensuring data integrity and proper operation. The relationship between tRASmin and memory frequency is also explored, demonstrating the importance of considering clock cycle duration and latency settings in memory configuration. The process of extracting and interpreting timing parameters from S P D data is also explained, emphasizing the need for adherence to defined standards and accurate calculation to ensure correct system behavior.
