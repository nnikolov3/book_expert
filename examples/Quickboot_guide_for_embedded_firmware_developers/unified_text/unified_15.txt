The Front Side Bus, or F S B, was a foundational architectural element in computer systems, serving as a proprietary parallel bus primarily responsible for communication between the central processing unit, or C P U, and the North Bridge. This North Bridge component, often termed the Memory Controller Hub, or M C H, facilitated the C P U's interface with main system memory and high-speed peripherals. The C P U would issue memory requests or peripheral commands across the F S B to the North Bridge, which then arbitrated and routed these requests to the appropriate device or memory module. However, with the integration of the North Bridge's functions directly into the C P U package, exemplified by Intel's Nehalem processor microarchitecture, the external Front Side Bus became obsolete. Its functionality was subsumed by internal, high-speed serial interconnects, forming an invisible fabric within the chip.Instead of an external F S B connecting the C P U to an external North Bridge, the communication pathway to the rest of the system, including memory and I O, evolved into a few dedicated serial interfaces. Intel's Quick Path Interconnect, or Q P I, became the successor for interprocessor communication in multi-socket systems and for connecting the C P U to the I O H, or I O Hub, and P C H, or Platform Controller Hub, components. Similarly, the Direct Media Interface, or D M I, and the Extended Serial Interconnect, or E S I link, served as the primary interchip links for integrating the C P U with peripheral controllers, enabling a more efficient, lower-latency, and scalable system design by reducing the number of hops and increasing point-to-point bandwidth.The North Bridge itself has undergone significant nomenclature evolution, having been known by various designations over time, including P C I Set, A G P Set, Memory Controller Hub, or M C H, and in more contemporary Intel architectures, the Uncore or System Agent. Historically, this component served as the principal interface for the processor on older chipset designs. It typically integrated key controllers such as the P C I host controller, often identified as P C I Bus zero, Dev zero, Func zero, the central memory controller, a dedicated Accelerated Graphics Port for external graphics cards, and in many instances, an integrated graphics processing unit. The P C I Host Controller within the North Bridge played a crucial role by translating the F S B signals into the appropriate protocol and electrical signaling required for P C I bus traffic. It also managed the P C I configuration space, allowing the operating system to discover and configure connected P C I devices.The memory controller component, often synonymous with the Memory Controller Hub, was responsible for managing the flow of data between the C P U and the dynamic random access memory, or D Ram, modules. The evolution of memory technology has seen several architectures rise and recede as industry standards. Early synchronous D Ram technologies, such as Fast Page, Extended Data Out, and Burst Extended Data Out, represented sequential advancements in optimizing sequential memory access patterns. However, the paradigm shifted significantly with the advent of Dual Data Rate memory, which is now the de jure industry standard. D D R Ram achieves higher effective data rates by transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, effectively doubling the peak bandwidth compared to S D Ram at the same clock frequency.The optimization of computational systems performance is fundamentally constrained by several architectural and physical parameters, particularly concerning memory subsystems. The maximum addressable memory within a system is directly dictated by the number of address lines employed by the memory controller and the C P U. Concurrently, the operational speed of the memory controller, coupled with the bandwidth and latency of the interconnecting bus fabric, establishes the data transfer rate between the C P U and main memory. The number of memory channels available, whether they operate in single, dual, quad, or even more parallel configurations, scales the aggregate memory bandwidth, enabling simultaneous data transfers and reducing effective access times for concurrent requests. Beyond these electrical and logical design considerations, the inherent thermal envelope of the system, especially when scaling to larger memory sizes and higher component densities, imposes a critical physical limitation.The Graphics engine, or G F X engine, is normally located as close to the physical memory and processor as the architecture allows for maximum graphics performance. In the old days, cards had their own private memory devices for rendering locally. While that is still the case for add-in cards, any integrated graphics today utilizes a piece of main system memory for its local memory. The killer add-in graphic cards for P C I have been replaced, first with the Accelerated Graphics Port, and now that has been replaced over time by the P C I Express Graphics port as the pole sitter of add-in devices. On some embedded and server designs, the P E G port can be used at a x sixteen P C I E channel for increased I O capacity.The link between the north and south bridges has been updated from the Hub link to the D M I link. Now with up to two gigabytes per second concurrent bandwidth, D M I provides up to four times faster I O bandwidth compared with the previous Intel proprietary Hub link I O interface. A similar enterprise south bridge interconnect, E S I, is available that supports speeds of two point five gigabits per second and connects to an Intel I C H south bridge or be configured as a by four P C I E Generation one port. The South Bridge, also known as the P I I X, I O Controller Hub, I C H, I O Hub, I O H, Enterprise South Bridge, E S B, and Platform Controller Hub, P C H, has taken on various forms over the years. All basically equate to the main I O channels to the outside world. If you want full documentation on the older corners of the newest integrated component, you may want to go all the way back to the P I I X documentation, which can still be downloaded from W W W dot Intel dot com.
