The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard is crucial for system firmware to identify and configure installed memory modules. Specifically, S P D Field number twelve, related to cycle time, and S P D fields zero E and zero F, which define supported C A S Latencies for S D Ram, are essential for determining the operational capabilities of the memory module. S P D Field twelve pertains to the minimum clock cycle time, often denoted as t C K min, which is fundamental to determining the maximum operating frequency of the memory module. This parameter represents the shortest valid clock pulse width. The subsequent sections delve into the representation of C A S Latency, or C L, values, which are critical timing parameters in synchronous dynamic random access memory, or S D Ram. C A S Latency indicates the number of clock cycles between the memory controller issuing a read command and the data becoming available on the output pins. The S P D fields zero E and zero F are utilized for this purpose, with Field zero E, corresponding to Byte fourteen, designated as the Least Significant Byte for C A S Latencies Supported, covering C L values from four through eleven. Field zero F, Byte fifteen, serves as the Most Significant Byte and extends this support for C L values from twelve through eighteen.The table provided illustrates the direct mapping between these S P D bytes and the supported C L values. For Byte fourteen, the hexadecimal value zero E hex is associated with a typical value of one E hex, which translates to supporting C L values of five, six, seven, and eight. For Byte fifteen, the hexadecimal value zero F hex is associated with a typical value of zero zero hex, indicating support for C L values of five, six, seven, and eight as well.According to the J E D E C specification, each bit position within these bytes corresponds to a specific C L value, starting from C L equals four up to C L equals eighteen. A '1' in a bit position signifies that the corresponding C L value is supported by the memory module, while a '0' indicates it is not. For instance, if C L equals six is a requirement for all D D R three speed bins, it implies that the bit corresponding to C L six must be set to '1' in the relevant S P D field.The presented material details the configuration of memory modules, specifically focusing on the "C A S Latencies Supported" fields within the Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure, as defined by the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification. This information is crucial for system initialization and optimization, allowing the C P U to understand the operational capabilities of the installed memory.The data is presented across two tables, Byte fourteen and Byte fifteen, each representing an eight-bit field. These bytes are further divided into individual bits, labeled from Bit seven down to Bit zero. Each bit position within these bytes is associated with a specific Column Address Strobe, or C A S, latency value, indicating whether that particular latency is supported by the memory module.For each bit position, a value of zero means this C A S Latency is not supported, and a value of one means this C A S Latency is supported. C A S latency is a fundamental timing parameter in dynamic random access memory, or D Ram, modules, representing the delay between the memory controller issuing a C A S command and the first data bit being available. Lower C A S latencies generally lead to higher memory bandwidth and improved system performance.The "S P D Field number fourteen and number fifteen define 'C A S Latencies Supported' from the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification" title indicates that this bit mapping is a standard mechanism for reporting memory characteristics. Table fifty-three, "D D R three ten sixty-six Speed Bins," further contextualizes this data, suggesting that the supported latencies are directly related to the operational speed or frequency of the D D R three memory modules.The number one hundred six ty six is a reference to the data transfer rate, typically measured in MegaTransfers per second. The speed bins likely correspond to different operational frequencies and voltage configurations for the D D R three memory. By reading these S P D fields, the system's firmware or operating system can determine the optimal timing parameters to configure the memory controller, ensuring stable and efficient operation.The table detailing timing parameters for D D R three to one O six six speed bin, specifically for C L-R C D-R P settings of seven dash seven dash seven and eight dash eight dash eight, lists parameters such as activation to internal read or write delay time, precharge command period, activate to activate or refresh command period, and activate to precharge command period. For the seven dash seven dash seven bin, the activate to internal read or write delay time is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds minimum and is not specified for maximum. The precharge command period for the seven dash seven dash seven bin is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds minimum, with no specified maximum. The activate to activate or refresh command period for the seven dash seven dash seven bin is fifty point six two five nanoseconds minimum, with a maximum of fifty-two point five nanoseconds.The activate to precharge command period for both bins is thirty-seven point five nanoseconds minimum, and nine times T R E F I for the maximum. The units for these parameters are nanoseconds, and a note indicates that R E F depends on T O P E R. Further down, the table presents timing for various C L and C W L combinations for the seven dash seven dash seven bin. For C L equals five and C W L equals five, the value is three point zero to three point three nanoseconds. For C L equals five and C W L equals six, it is reserved. For C L equals six and C W L equals five, it is two point five to three point three nanoseconds. For C L equals six and C W L equals six, it is also reserved.The supported C L settings for the seven dash seven dash seven bin are five, six, seven, and eight, while for the eight dash eight dash eight bin, they are five, six, and eight. Supported C W L settings for the seven dash seven dash seven bin are five and six, and the same for the eight dash eight dash eight bin. The notes section clarifies that R E F depends on T O P E R and that the C L and C W L settings result in T C K requirements, and when selecting T C K, both C L and C W L requirement settings need to be fulfilled. Finally, it notes that reserved settings are not allowed.
