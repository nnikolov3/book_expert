The chapter provides a high-level overview of the programming requirements of basic components in computing systems. To gain a complete understanding of a particular chip, it is essential to consult the technical documentation provided by the silicon provider, including the data sheet and programmer's reference manual. These documents offer detailed information about the chip's electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications, as well as its software-visible aspects, such as memory maps, control and status registers, and programming sequences.The industry standards that govern the initialization of computing systems are vast and varied, with up to seventy specifications applicable. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I, is a paramount specification that defines the software interface between the platform firmware and the operating system. The U E F I Specification, version two point seven, outlines the services, protocols, and data structures that the firmware must expose to the O S, enabling a standardized boot process, secure boot functionalities, and a consistent environment for platform configuration.Complementing the U E F I specification is the Platform Initialization Specification, version one point two, which addresses the internal architecture and execution flow of U E F I firmware. This hierarchical structure ensures that the complex task of hardware initialization, memory discovery, and component enumeration is performed in a standardized and predictable manner, ultimately presenting a uniform interface to the O S loader.Beyond the firmware layer, the interaction and connectivity of peripheral components are defined by Peripheral Component Interconnect, or P C I, standards. The P C I Express Base Specification is fundamental to understanding modern system architectures, as it defines the electrical and logical interfaces, packet formats, and transaction layer protocols that govern communication over a P C I E link. The P C I Local Bus Specification remains relevant for understanding legacy hardware and the evolutionary path of bus architectures.The P C I to P C I Bridge Architecture Specification is essential for facilitating system design and expanding connectivity, as it details the mechanisms by which P C I and P C I E segments can be interconnected. This specification enables the creation of complex bus topologies, with P C I bridges managing address translation, transaction routing, and interrupt forwarding between different bus segments.Additional specifications, such as the P C I Hot-Plug Specification, the P C I Bus Power Management Interface Specification, and the P C I B I O S Specification, are crucial for ensuring system stability, energy efficiency, and interoperability. The P C I Hot-Plug Specification addresses the capability for dynamic system reconfiguration, while the P C I Bus Power Management Interface Specification defines the methods for P C I devices and the bus itself to transition between various power consumption states.The P C I B I O S Specification dictates how the Basic Input/Output System discovers, configures, and initializes P C I peripherals during the boot sequence. The P C I Firmware Specification extends this, encompassing the broader set of firmware-level interactions, including the use of option R O M s on P C I expansion cards. The P C I Standard Hot-Plug Controller and Subsystem Specification provides a deeper architectural view, defining the dedicated hardware controllers and associated software layers required to manage the complexities of hot plugging.The evolution of the P C I bus is highlighted by the P C I-X Addendum to the P C I Local Bus Specification, which details improvements such as higher clock frequencies and architectural enhancements like split transactions. The ultimate evolution led to P C I Express, which represents a paradigm shift from a shared parallel bus to a high-speed, serial, point-to-point interconnect. The P C I Express to P C I/P C I-X Bridge Specification is critical, as it defines the complex translation mechanisms required for a P C I E root complex or switch to communicate with and control legacy P C I or P C I-X devices.In addition to P C I-related specifications, the document also covers I D E and A T A-related specifications, including the A T A/A T A P I six and A T A/A T A P I seven specifications. The Programming Interface for Bus Master I D E Controller and the P C I I D E Controller Specification are also detailed, along with the Serial A T A: High Speed Serialized A T Attachment, the Serial A T A International Organization: Serial A T A, and the Serial A T A Advanced Host Controller Interface, A H C I. These specifications are crucial for ensuring interoperability, managing system resources, and defining performance characteristics across a wide range of computing platforms.The list of specifications presented outlines fundamental aspects of computer system architecture, particularly concerning peripheral interconnection and storage device interfaces. These specifications are essential for creating a robust and stable pre-O S firmware, as they define the rules and protocols that govern the interaction between hardware and software components. By understanding and adhering to these specifications, system designers and developers can ensure that their systems are compatible, efficient, and reliable, ultimately leading to improved performance and functionality.
