The evolution of disk partitioning standards is a fundamental aspect of operating system design and data management. The G U I D Partition Table, or G P T, represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, the Master Boot Record, or M B R, and is an integral part of the U E F I specification. The primary impetus for this transition stems from the M B R's inherent limitation, which caps the maximum addressable disk and partition size at two point two terabytes. As storage technologies progressed, and individual hard disk drives expanded far beyond this capacity, a new standard was imperative. G P T addresses this by supporting immensely larger disk and partition sizes, reaching up to nine point four zettabytes, a capacity that far exceeds current commercial storage limits and provides substantial headroom for future growth. Most contemporary operating systems now either natively support G P T or necessitate its use, often alongside or in place of a legacy M B R scheme for compatibility. Structurally, the M B R typically resides at Logical Block Address zero, L B A zero, the very beginning of the disk. In contrast, the G P T header is strategically positioned at L B A one, immediately following any potential legacy M B R, with the actual partition table data located thereafter.Transitioning from storage organization to processor operational modes, we encounter the historical context of "Real Mode" in computing. Real Mode is characterized by its reliance on sixteen-bit code and sixteen-bit registers, defining a foundational execution environment for early x eighty-six processors. A critical constraint of Real Mode is its addressable memory limit: it can only access a maximum of one megabyte of physical memory. The mechanism for memory access in Real Mode employs a segment colon offset paradigm. The calculation of a physical address from a logical segment and offset pair involves a straightforward arithmetic operation. Specifically, the segment value is shifted left by four bits, which is arithmetically equivalent to multiplying it by sixteen, or appending a hexadecimal zero to its least significant end. This shifted segment value then serves as a base address, to which the offset value is added to yield the final twenty-bit physical address.An illustrative example of this calculation is provided. Imagine a conceptual table with two distinct columns, one for the identifier and another for its corresponding hexadecimal value. In the first row, we observe a "Segment" value of hexadecimal F zero zero zero. In the second row, the "Offset" is given as hexadecimal five four three two. To determine the physical address, the segment value of hexadecimal F zero zero zero is first conceptually shifted left by four bits, transforming it into hexadecimal F zero zero zero zero. This operation effectively provides the starting address of the memory segment. Then, the offset value of hexadecimal five four three two is arithmetically added to this shifted segment address. The result of this summation is a "Physical address" of hexadecimal F five four three two. This straightforward linear mapping effectively creates a twenty-bit address space from two sixteen-bit components.The inherent limitations of Real Mode, particularly its one megabyte memory barrier, necessitated a paradigm shift, leading to the development of "Protected Mode." Introduced to facilitate access to memory regions beyond the initial one megabyte, Protected Mode represents a significant architectural evolution. It enables the execution of thirty-two-bit code and beyond, dramatically expanding the addressable memory space. A fundamental departure from Real Mode's direct segmentation is Protected Mode's sophisticated memory management. Here, segment registers no longer directly hold segment base addresses. Instead, they function as "selectors" or pointers that reference "descriptor tables." These tables, which are structured data arrays, contain "descriptors" that fully define each memory segment. A descriptor provides comprehensive information, including the segment's true linear base address, its size or limit, and crucial access rights and privilege levels. This indirection, managed by the M M U, is key to enabling advanced operating system features such as virtual memory, robust memory protection between processes, and efficient multitasking, fundamentally transforming how software interacts with hardware memory.The system provides twenty-four-bit base addresses with a physical memory size of up to sixteen megabytes, offering support for virtual memory management on a segment swapping basis, and several protection mechanisms. The descriptors referred to are part of the Interrupt Descriptor Table, I D T, and Global Descriptor Tables, G D T. These topics are beyond the scope of this book. For more details on the G D T slash I D T, refer to the Intel sixty-four and I A thirty-two Architectures Software Developer's Manual online.Regarding Logical Addressing, the segment selector identifies the segment to be accessed, and the offset identifies the offset within that segment. The logical address is formed by adding the base of the segment selector to the offset. The processor translates the logical address to a physical address, making the conversion transparent to software.In Flat Protected Mode, the preferred mode for system firmware is flat protected mode. This mode allows addressing memory above one megabyte, but does not require a logical to physical conversion. The G D T is set up such that the memory maps one to one, meaning that the logical and physical addresses are identical.For the Reset Vector, when an Intel architecture boot strap processor, B S P, powers on, the first address fetched and executed is at physical address hexadecimal F F F F F F F zero, also known as the reset vector. This accesses the R O M or flash device at the top of the system's addressable memory space, ensuring that the processor can immediately begin the crucial boot process upon startup. The code at the reset vector is responsible for initializing the C P U, performing a power on self test, or P O S T, and preparing the system for loading the operating system, thereby establishing the fundamental operational state of the computing system.The boot loader must always contain a jump to the initialization code in the top sixteen bytes of the R O M, located at address hexadecimal one zero. This segment of memory is typically reserved for critical startup code, ensuring the system can transition from a powered-off state to a functional operating environment.The Programmable Interrupt Controller, P I C, or eight two five nine, contains two cascaded eight two five nine s with sixteen available I R Qs. The P I C provides I S A compatible interrupts and can support P C I based interrupts by mapping the P C I interrupt onto the compatible I S A interrupt line. The priority of the interrupts available in the eight two five nine is defined by the I R Q number itself, with zero being the highest priority. The timer interrupt, or I R Q zero, has the highest.Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers, A P I C, offer enhanced interrupt management capabilities. There are two types of A P I C, the I O X A P I C, and the Local A P I C. The I O X A P I C is contained in the south bridge, or I C H, and expands the number of I R Qs available. It also allows an interrupt priority scheme that is independent of the interrupt number. For example, interrupt nine can have a higher priority than interrupt four. Each I R Q has an associated redirection table entry that can be enabled or disabled, providing flexible interrupt management.The discussion highlights the significance of interrupt controllers in modern computer architectures, underscoring the evolution from simpler P I Cs to more advanced A P I Cs. These controllers play a crucial role in managing interrupts, which are signals to the C P U that an event requires attention. Effective interrupt handling is essential for system responsiveness, reliability, and overall performance. As computing systems continue to advance, the role of interrupt controllers will remain vital, ensuring that systems can efficiently handle the complexities of modern computing workloads.
