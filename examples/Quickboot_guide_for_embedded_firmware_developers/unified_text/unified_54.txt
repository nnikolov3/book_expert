The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, or A C P I, is a comprehensive standard that enables operating systems to discover, configure, and manage hardware components, with a particular emphasis on power management. A crucial aspect of A C P I is its use of various tables and a hierarchical namespace to describe system hardware. Among these, the Secondary System Description Table, or S S D T, plays a vital role as a modular extension of the Differentiated System Description Table, or D S D T. The S S D T is used for multiple hardware support, allowing the system to adapt to different Central Processing Unit, or C P U, models and Operating System, or O S, expectations.The Multiple Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller Description Table, or M A D T, is another essential table that describes the system's interrupt topology, including I O x A P I Cs and Local C P U A P I Cs. This information is critical for configuring interrupt routing and enabling efficient interrupt dispatch in multi-processor systems. The Smart Battery Table, or S B S T, provides detailed information about the intelligent battery system, enabling the O S to implement sophisticated power management strategies. The Embedded Controller Boot Resources Table, or E C D T, allows the O S to access embedded controller resources earlier in the boot sequence, ensuring correct hardware configuration and a smoother transition from firmware to O S control.The Boot Graphics Resource Table, or B G R T, ensures a seamless visual transition during system boot by providing the location of the board splash screen. The Firmware Performance Data Table, or F P D T, captures pre-O S firmware execution timings, enabling system performance analysis and optimization. These tables, along with others like the System Locality Distance Information Table, or S L I T, and the System Resource Affinity Table, or S R A T, provide the O S with a detailed understanding of the system's architecture, facilitating optimized performance, power management, and device enumeration.The A C P I Namespace is a hierarchical representation of the system, divided into high-level scopes that encompass all system components. This namespace includes both static and dynamic objects, as well as methods that can be invoked by O S drivers. Device Objects are defined using the A C P I Source Language, or A S L, and can be enumerated using a Hardware I D, or H I D, or an Address, or A D R. The A C P I Namespace serves as a structured framework for the O S to manage complex hardware configurations, providing a high degree of abstraction and flexibility.To create and manage A C P I tables, developers can use A S L compilers, such as those provided by Microsoft and Intel. These compilers generate A C P I Machine Language, or A M L, code from A S L source files. The A C P I C A project offers additional resources, including a compiler tool and user guides. By understanding and utilizing the A C P I standard, developers can create efficient, scalable, and power-aware systems that meet the demands of modern computing environments.For further information on A C P I, the A C P I specification is a valuable resource, providing ample example code and detailed explanations. The A C P I Component Architecture website offers additional documentation, including user guides and programmer reference manuals. While some resources, such as the A C P I Implementer's Guide, may be obsolete, they can still provide relevant insights and information for developers working with A C P I. By exploring these resources and understanding the intricacies of A C P I, developers can unlock the full potential of this critical standard, enabling the creation of sophisticated, high-performance systems that meet the evolving needs of the computing industry.
