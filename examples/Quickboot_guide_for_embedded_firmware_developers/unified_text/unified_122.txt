The system boot process is a complex sequence of events that involves various firmware components and hardware interactions. Figure 11.5 presents a state diagram illustrating the boot process, which commences with a "First Assembled" state. This initial state is followed by a transition to "B zero (first boot)," signifying the initial power-on sequence for a newly manufactured or reset system. A subsequent transition from "B zero (first boot)" leads to "B one (Full Boot - various flows)," which represents a more comprehensive boot mode encompassing different operational paths or configurations.The boot process can be influenced by various factors, including hardware, BIOS, or software level changes, which may trigger a full boot or a fast boot, depending on the system's configuration and the nature of the changes. The system's boot mode can be configured using UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) settings, which provide a standardized framework for system initialization. The UEFI-defined boot modes, listed in Table 11.1, include "Full Boot Configuration" and "Fast Boot" modes, which can be aligned with the system's B-states.The boot process is divided into several phases, each with its own time budget. The SEC/PEI phase budget allocates five hundred milliseconds for critical operations such as memory initialization, BIOS shadowing, and CPU patch updates. The DXE phase budget, also allocated five hundred milliseconds, involves dynamic execution or extended device initialization, with individual module initialization times managed to ensure the system initializes within its overall time budget.The DXE module logic requires proper delay provisioning to permit other modules to execute concurrently or sequentially. Specifically, "CPU DXE" and "PCH DXE" modules are each allocated an extended time budget of one hundred milliseconds. The "ME DXE budget" is set at ten milliseconds, with a clarification that this budget excludes "MEBx" during the "Bn" state. "Option ROM"s and "Raid Storage Technology ROM" are allocated zero milliseconds of execution time, indicating they are either disabled or not expected to contribute to the boot time in this configuration.The system's boot time is also influenced by the BDS phase budget, which allocates five hundred milliseconds for boot device selection, and the TSL (Transient Layer) phase, which allocates five hundred milliseconds for OS bootloader execution. The overall end-to-end boot time is affected by the OS bootloader time, which occurs after the BIOS boot has ended.In certain environments, such as IT activity, development, or laboratory settings, the system may not be suitable for a fast boot scenario. In such cases, the atypical full boot path or first boot paths continue to be supported, and decisions about which path to take can be automated or triggered by external factors. The system's boot configuration settings can be adjusted to accommodate different use cases and requirements, ensuring optimal system performance and initialization. The performance analysis reveals that the system's boot time is a critical factor in its overall performance. The two-second budget for the boot process is divided into several phases, each with its own time allocation. The SEC/PEI phase budget and the DXE phase budget are allocated five hundred milliseconds each, with the remaining time allocated to the BDS phase and the TSL phase. The system's boot time is influenced by various factors, including hardware, BIOS, or software level changes, which may trigger a full boot or a fast boot, depending on the system's configuration and the nature of the changes.The system's boot configuration settings can be optimized to reduce the boot time and improve system performance. For example, the use of UEFI settings can provide a standardized framework for system initialization, and the allocation of time budgets for different phases can help ensure that the system initializes within its overall time budget. Additionally, the system's boot mode can be configured to accommodate different use cases and requirements, such as fast boot or full boot scenarios. Overall, the system's boot process is a complex sequence of events that requires careful management of time budgets, firmware components, and hardware interactions. By optimizing the system's boot configuration settings and allocating time budgets effectively, the system's boot time can be reduced, and its overall performance can be improved. The use of UEFI settings and the allocation of time budgets for different phases can help ensure that the system initializes within its overall time budget, providing optimal system performance and initialization.
