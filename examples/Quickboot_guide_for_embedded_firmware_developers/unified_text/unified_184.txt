The Serial Presence Detect (SPD) standard defines specific fields that communicate critical physical and electrical characteristics of memory modules to system firmware. Field zero X three C, designated as the Unbuffered Module Nominal Height, specifies the vertical dimension of a fully assembled memory module including any added components such as heat spreaders. For down-on-board memory designs, this field should be set to hexadecimal zero zero, indicating a module height less than fifteen millimeters. The encoding scheme uses bits seven through five as reserved, while bits four through zero represent incremental height ranges with a baseline of fifteen millimeters. A binary value of five zeros corresponds to modules with heights less than or equal to fifteen millimeters. As the binary value increases, so does the specified height range, with each increment representing an additional millimeter. For example, binary zero zero zero zero one indicates a height greater than fifteen millimeters but less than or equal to sixteen millimeters, and this pattern continues up to binary one one one one one, which represents modules with heights exceeding forty five millimeters.Following the height specification, SPD Field zero X three D addresses the Unbuffered Module Maximum Thickness, defining the E dimension in millimeters. This measurement accounts for components extending above the module circuit board surface. The thickness calculations differentiate between front and back dimensions relative to the printed circuit board. The front thickness is determined by subtracting the PCB thickness from the E one dimension, while the back thickness equals the E dimension minus the E one dimension. Bits seven through four encode the maximum back thickness, and bits three through zero encode the maximum front thickness, each with a baseline of one millimeter. Binary zero zero zero zero in either nibble indicates a thickness less than or equal to one millimeter, with progressive binary values mapping to corresponding thickness ranges up to fifteen millimeters. As with the height field, this standardized approach ensures consistent characterization of module dimensions for manufacturing and system integration purposes.Continuing with the SPD specification, Field zero X three E identifies the Reference Raw Card Used for unbuffered DDR3 SDRAM modules. Each DIMM equivalent consists of a single rank of x8 SDRAM devices without error correction code (ECC), corresponding to Raw Card Version A, x64 configuration. This specific setup requires SPD field sixty two to be set to hexadecimal zero zero. The reference raw card enumerators are formally described in JEDEC Standard No. twenty one C, specifically the two hundred forty pin PC3-6400/PC3-8500/PC3-10600/PC3-12800 DDR3 SDRAM Unbuffered DIMM Design Specification, Revision one point zero one, dated November two thousand nine. This documentation provides the foundational design parameters for module configurations and requires access through the JEDEC website with an authenticated account. The field mapping table confirms that byte sixty two in decimal, represented as hexadecimal three E, carries the unbuffered reference raw card designation with a typical value of hexadecimal zero zero, corresponding to Raw Card A in x64 configuration. These specifications collectively enable system firmware to properly recognize and configure memory modules based on their physical design characteristics.
