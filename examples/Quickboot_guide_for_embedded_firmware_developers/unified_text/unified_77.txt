The process of initializing an operating system involves several critical stages, including the use of a boot list to prioritize the selection of operating system images for purposes such as system recovery, validation, or manufacturing. This boot list allows for the establishment of a priority order, enabling the system to choose between different operating system images, including recovery, validation, or manufacturing operating systems, over the standard production boot image.In the context of storage device organization, the Partition Table plays a fundamental role in defining how data is logically divided and managed on a disk. Although this topic is typically explored in detail in earlier sections of technical documentation, it is essential for understanding disk geometry and management. The File System, a critical component of any operating system, governs how data is stored, organized, and accessed on storage devices. The evolution of file systems has seen continuous innovation since the inception of computing, with notable examples including the File Allocation Table, or F A T, and the EXT file system.F A T, originating from early computing eras, has seen various iterations, including F A T twelve, F A T sixteen, and F A T thirty-two. F A T twelve, historically associated with floppy disks, has limitations in capacity, whereas F A T thirty-two supports significantly larger storage volumes, up to two terabytes. Microsoft provides licensing for F A T to U E F I developers, indicating its continued relevance in certain system initialization contexts, particularly when integrated with E F I solutions and the Extended Disk Kernel, or E D K. In contrast, the EXT file system, popular within Linux and open-source communities, offers an alternative approach to file system management.Booting a legacy operating system involves a three-step process: consuming the Master Boot Record, or M B R, loading the legacy O S loader, and performing the handoff to the operating system. The M B R, residing at the beginning of a bootable storage device, contains the primary boot loader, partition table information, and a boot signature. The B I O S scans the partitions to identify bootable ones, and the user or system configuration can select a preferred bootable partition, which is added to a boot target list and prioritized for execution.The legacy O S loader relies on services provided by the legacy B I O S, including interrupt calls such as Int thirteen h for disk operations, Int sixteen h for P S slash two keyboard interface, and Int ten h for video output from video B I O S. The B I O S's S M I handler also provides legacy U S B keyboard support via port sixty-four emulation. Depending on the desired features enabled by the boot loader, the O S needs different tables, including the Memory Map, Programmable Interrupt Routing, Multi-Processor Specification, Minimal Boot Loader for Intel Architecture, and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, or A C P I.A C P I tables are required if the features are enabled by the boot loader and needed by the O S. Most modern operating systems, including R T O S, are A C P I aware. The Multi-Processor Specification table is necessary if there is more than one Intel processing agent in the system. The Programmable Interrupt Routing table and interrupt-based memory map are almost always required, with details available in the respective specifications. These tables play a crucial role in ensuring the operating system can effectively manage system resources, handle interrupts, and provide the necessary functionality for a wide range of applications.
