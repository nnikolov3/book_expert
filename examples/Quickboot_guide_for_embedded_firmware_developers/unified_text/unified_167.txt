The calculation of the minimum Row Active to Row Active Delay, denoted as tRRDmin, for Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) is a critical aspect of determining the operational speed and stability of the memory. The values are represented by bits seven through zero, and the defined range for these values is from one to two hundred fifty-five. A crucial aspect of the calculation involves the Mean Time Between (MTB) failures and a Fine Time Base (FTB) offset. If the tRRDmin cannot be divided evenly by the MTB, the result must be rounded up to the next larger integer. This integer, along with the Fine Offset for tRRDmin, is used to derive the actual time value.The provided tables illustrate the relationship between these parameters through several examples. The columns are labeled: tRP (in MTB units), MTB (in nanoseconds), tRP Offset (FTB units), FTB (in nanoseconds), tRP Result (in nanoseconds), and Use. For instance, a tRP value of one hundred, which is hexadecimal sixty-four, has an MTB of zero point one two five nanoseconds. The tRP Offset is zero, and the FTB is zero point zero zero one nanoseconds, resulting in a tRP Result of twelve point five nanoseconds for DDR3-800. Similarly, a tRP value of one hundred twenty, represented as hexadecimal seventy-eight, has an MTB of zero point one two five nanoseconds, a tRP Offset of zero, and an FTB of zero point zero zero one nanoseconds, yielding a tRP Result of fifteen nanoseconds, used for DDR3-800E.Observing the tables, we see consistent MTB values of zero point one two five nanoseconds. The tRP values are given in MTB units, which are effectively discrete steps. The tRP Offset and FTB columns, often showing zero and zero point zero zero one respectively, suggest a fine-tuning mechanism. The tRP Result, in nanoseconds, appears to be calculated based on the tRP value, the MTB unit value, and potentially the offset, though in these examples with zero offset, the calculation seems simpler. For example, when tRP is one hundred and MTB is zero point one two five nanoseconds, the result is twelve point five nanoseconds. This suggests a direct scaling where tRP (in MTB units) multiplied by the MTB value in nanoseconds gives the base result, and then any offsets are applied.The tables also provide a mapping from these parameters to specific DDR3 memory types and their performance characteristics, such as DDR3-1333H, DDR3-1600, DDR3-1866, and DDR3-2133, with suffixes like H, J, G, K, L, M, N indicating specific performance or feature variations within those speed bins. The "downbin" notation suggests that a module may be rated for a higher speed but is being operated or tested at a lower speed. The notes provide crucial context, directing the reader to the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) data stored on the memory module and to the device datasheet for downbin support details.Furthermore, the page presents timing parameters for DDR3 1066 Speed Bin with configurations CL RCD RP. The parameters include ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay time, PRECHARGE command period, and ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE or Refresh command period. The supported CL settings are five, six, seven, and eight, and the supported CWL settings are five and six, with units in clock cycles. The tables detail the minimum and maximum values for these parameters, with units in nanoseconds, and provide notes indicating dependencies on other parameters like tREFI.In conclusion, the calculation of tRRDmin and the mapping of timing parameters to specific DDR3 memory types are critical for determining the operational speed and stability of the memory. The provided tables and notes offer a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between these parameters and the resulting memory speed classifications. By analyzing the tables and understanding the dependencies between the parameters, one can gain insight into the performance characteristics of different DDR3 memory modules and their suitability for various applications.
