The provided text describes various timing parameters for memory operations, specifically within a dynamic random access memory (D Ram) system. These parameters are crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer and system stability. The text outlines setup and hold times for control and address signals relative to the clock signal, denoted as C K. For instance, the 'ADDR setup to C K, C K#' parameters specify the minimum time an address signal must be stable before the active clock edge.The 'CTRL, CMD, ADDR setup to C K, C K#' entries indicate the setup time for command and address signals. Other critical parameters include pulse width specifications, such as the 'Minimum CTRL, CMD, ADDR pulse width', which defines the minimum duration these signals must remain asserted. The table also outlines delays associated with different command sequences, such as 'ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay' and 'PRECHARGE command period'. These are often expressed in nanoseconds or referenced to speed bin tables for more detailed specifications.The 'ACTIVATE to PRECHARGE command period' and 'ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE command period' represent crucial timing intervals that dictate how quickly a memory bank can transition between operations. The 'ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE command' parameter is further broken down by page size, with values dependent on the minimum of a certain number of clock cycles or a fixed nanosecond value. For example, for a one K B page size, the delay is specified as the greater of four C K cycles or ten nanoseconds.The 'Four ACTIVATE windows' parameter represents the maximum number of ACTIVATE commands that can be issued within a specific window, with values ranging from forty down to thirty. This is followed by various recovery and delay timings, such as 'Write recovery time', 'Delay from start of internal WRITE transaction to internal READ command', and 'READ to PRECHARGE time'. These parameters are vital for internal refresh cycles and data integrity.The text also describes the extraction and interpretation of a specific timing parameter, the minimum row precharge delay, denoted as t R P min, from a Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet. This parameter is stored within the Serial Presence Detect (S P D) data structure of a memory module. The process of extracting this value involves referencing a specific datasheet and utilizing a medium timebase divisor.The example illustrates that a t R P value found in the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds. This raw value is then processed by dividing it by the medium timebase divisor, which yields a result of one hundred and five. This value is then converted to its hexadecimal representation, which is hexadecimal sixty nine.The provided table details this process, showing that byte twenty corresponds to the field name "Min. Row Precharge Delay (t R P min)". The typical value stored for this field is shown as hexadecimal sixty nine, and its definition is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds. This byte specifically defines the minimum S D R a m row precharge delay in units of the medium timebase.The table also shows various parameters related to memory timing, including t R P in M T B units, M T B in nanoseconds, t R P Offset F T B in units one, F T B in nanoseconds, t R P Result in nanoseconds, and the use. For example, a t R P value of one hundred, which is hexadecimal sixty four, results in a t R P Result of twelve point five nanoseconds for D D R three dash eight hundred.In summary, the text provides a detailed description of various timing parameters for memory operations, including setup and hold times, pulse width specifications, and delays associated with different command sequences. It also describes the extraction and interpretation of the minimum row precharge delay from a Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet, highlighting the importance of cross-referencing device-specific documentation for accurate parameter interpretation. These timing parameters are critical for maintaining data integrity and achieving optimal performance in memory systems. The minimum row active to row active delay, denoted as t R R D min, is a fundamental parameter in memory controllers, ensuring proper row activation sequencing. This parameter dictates the minimum number of clock cycles between successive row activation commands to different rows within the memory array, critical for managing internal charge leakage and ensuring data retention. The presented values for t R R D would typically be dependent on the memory technology and operating conditions.Bits seven to zero represent the Minimum Row Active to Row Active Delay, denoted as t R R D min, with values defined from one to two hundred fifty five. If t R P min cannot be divided evenly by the M T B, this byte must be rounded up to the next larger integer and the Fine Offset for t R P min is used for correction to get the actual value. The table shows various parameters related to memory timing, including t R P in M T B units, M T B in nanoseconds, t R P Offset F T B in units one, F T B in nanoseconds, t R P Result in nanoseconds, and the use.For example, a t R P value of one hundred five, or hexadecimal sixty nine, results in a t R P Result of thirteen point one two five nanoseconds, corresponding to D D R three dash one thousand sixty six F. Another entry with t R P as one hundred twenty, hexadecimal seventy eight, shows an M T B of zero point one two five nanoseconds, resulting in a t R P Result of fifteen nanoseconds, used for D D R three dash one thousand sixty six G. In conclusion, the provided text offers a comprehensive overview of the timing parameters that govern memory operations, emphasizing the significance of accurate parameter interpretation for reliable data transfer and system stability. The minimum row precharge delay and minimum row active to row active delay are critical parameters that must be carefully considered in memory system design to ensure optimal performance and data integrity.
