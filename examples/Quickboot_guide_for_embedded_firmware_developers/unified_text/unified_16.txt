The link between the north and south bridges in a computer system has undergone significant updates, transitioning from the Hub link to the Direct Media Interface, or D M I link. This update provides up to two gigabytes per second concurrent bandwidth, resulting in up to four times faster input output bandwidth compared to the previous Intel proprietary Hub link interface. A similar enterprise south bridge interconnect, known as E S I, supports speeds of two point five gigabits per second and can be configured as a by four P C I E Generation one port. Historically, these links were referred to as virtual bridges due to their transparency to P C I transactions. With P C I bus zero devices in both the north and south complexes, there is no change in P C I bus numbers when crossing the border between chips, allowing software to remain unaware of whether it is interacting with a two-chip or a one-chip System on Chip solution. The D M I link handles not only P C I transitions but also proprietary chip-to-chip or die-to-die messages, particularly relevant in highly integrated System on Chip designs.The south bridge, also known by various names such as P I I X, I C H, I O H, E S B, and P C H, has evolved over time, with each iteration serving as the main input output channel to the outside world. For comprehensive understanding, referring back to older documentation, such as that of the P I I X, can be beneficial. The P I I X, formally known as the eight two three seven one F B, is a multifunction P C I device that implements a P C I to I S A bridge function and a P C I I D E function. It integrates common input output functions found in I S A based P C systems, including a seven-channel D M A controller, two eight two five nine interrupt controllers, an eight two five four timer counter, and power management support. The P I I X supports type F transfers, programmable chip select decoding, and provides an interface for I D E hard disks and C D R O Ms. Its evolution, through versions such as P I I X three and P I I X four, added features like I O A P I C, U S B U H C I, P C I two point one, and upgraded D M A and I D E capabilities, significantly enhancing system performance and compatibility.The introduction of the first I C H, or I C H zero, by Intel marked a significant advancement, incorporating several fundamental features that impacted system firmware. These included a D M I to P C I bridge, Serial A T A for hard drives and S S D s, U S B one dot one, U S B two dot zero, and soon U S B three dot zero, Intel High Definition Audio, a Serial Presence Interface to connect to N O R based N V Ram, a Low Pin Count Interface for accessing the Super I O or Embedded Controllers, and P C I Express Root Ports for connectivity to P C I E buses. These features underscore the continuous drive in computer architecture towards increased integration, enhanced peripheral support, and optimized power management. The evolution of chipset architectures, as seen in the progression from P I I X to I C H and beyond, reflects strategic decisions balancing the adoption of new standards against overall system design goals and market demands, ultimately shaping the efficiency, performance, and capabilities of modern computing systems.
