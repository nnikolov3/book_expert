The reduction in the size of the feature set of a shell environment can have significant implications for security. By restricting the features available to the end user, the risk of unauthorized system modifications can be reduced, thereby enhancing security. This approach is particularly useful when the end user is not expected to use the shell, as it allows for the elimination of unnecessary features while still providing enough functionality to initiate a platform debug session. Furthermore, it is possible to have a limited built-in shell launch a large and feature-rich shell from a peripheral storage device, such as a Universal Serial Bus drive, Digital Versatile Disc, or even over a network.In the context of new platform testing, a common practice involves booting a minimal shell to test the hardware before loading a full modern operating system. This shell provides the necessary low-level access to hardware, enabling direct interaction with the system's internal commands and the execution of custom-designed shell applications. Such applications can perform critical diagnostics like memory testing, peripheral device validation, and system configuration checks, all before a complete operating system is loaded. The Extensible Firmware Interface and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface shells are prime examples of such environments, offering built-in capabilities for these diagnostic tasks and presenting a clear advantage for testing and debugging new hardware.The strategic advantage of this methodology is further amplified when considering the hardware's expected quality, especially in scenarios like manufacturing. The usage model dictates that initial system testing, which can occur during the manufacturing line, should be as comprehensive as possible. Utilizing a shell that can perform a level of testing before the operating system loads, and then smoothly transition to the full operating system, streamlines this process. This is readily achievable with environments like the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, where the operating system loader effectively becomes an extension of this initial testing phase, seamlessly integrating the loaded operating system with the pre-boot diagnostics.To automate this process, a startup script, typically named `startup.nsh`, can be configured to perform a series of tests. If all tests pass, the script proceeds to launch the operating system loader application. The scripting language supports conditional logic and can interact with environment variables, allowing for dynamic behavior. An example script illustrates these concepts, demonstrating how to check for the existence of a file, execute commands, and examine error conditions to determine the next course of action.Both the Extensible Firmware Interface Shell and the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Shell are Unified Extensible Firmware Interface applications, capable of running on any current Unified Extensible Firmware Interface platform. These applications have very low system requirements, needing only basic services like `Simple Text Input`, `Simple Text Output`, and `Device Path To Text` for console input/output and device identification. They can also utilize additional protocols if present, such as `Simple File System` or `Block I/O`.The Extensible Firmware Interface Shell is a nonstandard shell, meaning there is no predefined behavior for a given command, and no predefined set of commands must be present. However, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Shell two point zero is a standards-based version, offering all the commands of the Extensible Firmware Interface Shell, plus extended and enhanced commands, and new additions. This means that script files written for the Extensible Firmware Interface Shell will work on the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Shell, but the reverse is not always true. It is recommended to write scripts using the new features of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Shell when possible, as they simplify and enhance script capabilities.Significant changes in the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Shell include the concept of levels and profiles for the shell, which are sets of commands that can be queried for availability before they are called. This is important for ensuring that a script can execute correctly, even if certain commands are not present in the shell. With the old Extensible Firmware Interface Shells, this was not possible, and scripts had to rely on the platform having the correct version of the shell. In contrast, the newer Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Shells allow for more flexibility and reliability in script execution.
