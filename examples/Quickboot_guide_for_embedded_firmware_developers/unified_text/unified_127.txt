The optimization of Serial Peripheral Interface, or S P I, flash memory access is crucial for improving system performance, particularly during the boot process. Series six and seven chipsets support fifty megahertz Dual Output Fast Read, or D O F R, which is a significant enhancement for components that also support Quad Fast Read. The S P I interface is often a bottleneck in boot speed, and even small changes in its performance can have a substantial impact on overall system performance, with a relatively minor effect on the bill of materials.To further optimize flash component accesses, techniques such as configuring for faster read access and enabling prefetch can be employed. For instance, during the boot process, B I O S option setup data, which can be several kilobytes in size, may be referenced multiple times, incurring a latency of around one millisecond for thirty-three megahertz S P I for each reference. Optimizations can include reinstalling the read-only variable P P I with a new version that contains a copy of the setup data in C A R memory, allowing the setup data to be read only once from the S P I flash, and caching this data in memory to prevent unnecessary S P I accesses during system resume events like the S three power state.Moreover, enabling the buffers on components to prefetch data from the flash device can significantly enhance performance, provided the chipset supports this functionality. Setting up S P I prefetch as early as the S E C phase is recommended, and performance profiling should be conducted to compare the boot times of individual U E F I modules under prefetch-enabled conditions. This analysis can reveal potential performance impacts, especially when firmware volumes are shadowed, a technique that can be particularly instructive to examine for its influence on boot performance.In addition to these optimizations, minimizing the number of flash writes by combining several writes into one is another strategy to improve performance. The B I O S can achieve this by buffering data in memory or a variable for subsequent write-through to the S P I flash. The P C H B I O S Writer's Guide provides optimal S P I prefetch settings, and it is essential to follow the guidelines outlined in Table twelve point one to improve S P I flash access latency through hardware and firmware co-design. These guidelines cover aspects such as fast read mode, quad data pin support, maximum clock rate, and software-controllable prefetch mode, aiming to reduce boot time by several seconds.Interface and device accesses can also be time-consuming due to the nature of the interfaces and devices or the necessity of issuing multiple accesses to the particular controller, bus, and device. To address this, D M I optimizations can be applied by enabling the highest D M I link speed as early as possible, preferably in the S E C phase, if hardware design constraints permit. This can help minimize I/O latency to the P C H and onboard devices, with a potential six to fourteen percent improvement in I/O configuration speed by training the link to five G T slash s, or Gen two speed. However, there may be scenarios where running the link at top speeds all the time is not advisable, and the B I O S option may control the D M I link speed, which could be read later in the boot process, allowing for down-speed training if necessary.Lastly, processor optimizations, such as C P U Turbo Enabling, can further enhance system performance. By leveraging these various optimization strategies, system designers and developers can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of their systems, particularly during critical phases like booting, and ensure that the system operates efficiently and effectively under various workloads and conditions.
