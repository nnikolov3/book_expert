The provided text fragments pertain to the technical specifications and timing parameters of Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) modules. Specifically, the discussion revolves around the Minimum Active to Active/Refresh Time, denoted as tRC, and its constituent components, including the Minimum Active to Active/Refresh Delay Time (tRCmin) and the Minimum Refresh Recovery Delay (tRFCmin). These parameters are essential for ensuring data integrity and system stability in memory operations.The timing parameters are defined within specific bit fields in a larger data structure, identified as Byte 21 Bits 7-4 and Byte 23 Bits 7-0. These fields define a base timing unit, referred to as MTB units, with values ranging from 1 to 4095. The MTB unit is quantified in nanoseconds, with a consistent value of 0.125 nanoseconds across the provided data. The table columns represent key timing metrics, including tRC in MTB units, MTB in nanoseconds, tRC Offset in FTB units, FTB in nanoseconds, and the calculated tRC Result in nanoseconds. The Use column specifies the memory type associated with each timing set, such as DDR3-800D, DDR3-1066E, and progressively higher frequencies.Analyzing the data reveals correlations between tRC values and memory speed grades. For instance, lower tRC results are associated with lower-speed memory modules, while higher tRC results are seen with higher-speed modules. The tRC Offset column shows variations, with some entries being zero and others displaying negative values, effectively shortening the overall tRC and allowing for faster operation.The supported CL (Column Latency) settings and CWL (Column Write Latency) settings are also detailed, with specific combinations resulting in tCK (clock cycle) requirements. The notes clarify that tREFI (Refresh Interval) depends on the operating temperature and that certain CL and CWL combinations necessitate specific tCK requirements, with reserved settings being disallowed.Furthermore, the extraction and interpretation of timing parameters from the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet are discussed, focusing on SPD Field #23 (Minimum Active to Active/Refresh Delay Time) and SPD Field #24 and #25 (Minimum Refresh Recovery Delay). These fields must be extracted and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor to obtain the correct timing values.In summary, the provided text fragments offer a comprehensive overview of the technical specifications and timing parameters of DDR3 SDRAM modules, highlighting the importance of understanding these parameters for optimal memory performance and system stability. The detailed breakdown of timing parameters, including tRC, tRFCmin, and their relationships with memory speed grades and latency settings, enables precise configuration of memory controllers to optimize performance and reliability.
