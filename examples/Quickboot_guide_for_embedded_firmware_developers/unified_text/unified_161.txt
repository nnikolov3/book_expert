The performance analysis of memory modules reveals key timing parameters that are crucial for synchronous memory operation. The table presents these parameters, including speed grade, data rate in megatransfers per second, target RCD, RP, and CL timings. For instance, the speed grade minus one two five superscript one, superscript two, has a data rate of one thousand six hundred megatransfers per second, with target timings of eleven dash eleven dash eleven, and RCD, RP, and CL values of thirteen point seven five nanoseconds. As the data rate decreases, these timings generally increase. For example, the speed grade minus one eight seven, with a data rate of one thousand sixty six megatransfers per second, has target timings of eight dash eight dash eight, and the CAS Latency is eight nanoseconds. The notes section elaborates on backward compatibility aspects, highlighting that certain configurations are compatible with specific speed grades, such as minus one eight seven E, minus one five E, and minus one eight seven.The document also references SPD Field number sixteen, which pertains to the "Minimum CAS Latency Time" as specified in a Micron MT four one J two five six M eight datasheet. This field stores a critical timing parameter that measures the minimum latency required for a read operation after the column address has been received. Furthermore, SPD Field zero hexadecimal eleven relates to "Write Recovery Time" or tWR, which defines the minimum time required between the completion of a write command and the next command being issued to the memory device.The calculation of tWR involves dividing the raw value found in the datasheet by the Medium Timebase Divisor. For example, if the tWR value is fifteen nanoseconds and the Medium Timebase Divisor is zero point one two five nanoseconds, the result is one hundred twenty, which is represented in hexadecimal as zero x seventy eight. This value is then used to determine the actual write recovery time, taking into account the system's operating frequency and the minimum write recovery time supported by the DDR three SDRAM.The BIOS executes a three-step process to determine the appropriate write recovery timing. First, it determines the common operating frequency of all modules in the system, ensuring that the corresponding value of tCK falls between tCKmin and tCKmax. If tCKactual is not a JEDEC standard value, the next smaller standard tCKmin value is used for calculating write recovery. Second, the BIOS calculates the desired write recovery, WRdesired, by dividing tWRmin by tCKactual and rounding up to the nearest whole number. Finally, the BIOS determines the actual write recovery, WRactual, by taking the maximum of WRdesired and the minimum write recovery supported by the DDR three SDRAM.The table presents parameters related to memory timing, specifically focusing on write recovery. The values suggest a relationship between a minimum write recovery time, a base timing unit, and an actual calculated write recovery time, applicable across various performance tiers of DDR three memory modules. For instance, the table shows that a tWRmin value of 120 in MTB units, with a timebase of 0.125 nanoseconds, results in a tWR result of 15 nanoseconds, which is applicable to all DDR three speed grades. This information is essential for system integrators to ensure interoperability between memory modules of varying specifications and to optimize system performance.
