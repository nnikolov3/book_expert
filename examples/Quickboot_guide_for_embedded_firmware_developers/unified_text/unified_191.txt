The Serial Presence Detect (SPD) data structure plays a critical role in modern memory module configuration, providing essential information that system firmware uses to properly initialize and manage installed memory. Within this structure, specific byte fields are designated for manufacturer identification and proprietary data storage, ensuring both standardization and flexibility in module design.Bytes one hundred forty eight and one hundred forty nine contain the DRAM Manufacturer ID Code, which utilizes a standardized encoding mechanism defined by the JEDEC JEP-106 specification. This two-byte field is structured such that byte one hundred forty eight encodes the number of continuation codes used in the manufacturer's ID, specifically using bits six through zero for this count, while bit seven of byte one hundred forty eight provides odd parity for the continuation code count. Byte one hundred forty nine contains the last nonzero byte of the manufacturer's ID code as specified in JEP-106. For example, the value hexadecimal eight zero two C corresponds to Micron Technology, demonstrating how these bytes map to recognized manufacturers. This encoding approach mirrors the same values used in fields hexadecimal seventy five through seventy six, maintaining consistency across the SPD structure for SDRAM component identification.The module revision code is stored in bytes one hundred forty six and one hundred forty seven, corresponding to hexadecimal addresses ninety two and ninety three. While the SPD specification does not define a universal format for this revision information, it allows individual manufacturers to implement their own tracking and decoding mechanisms within these bytes. For down-on-board memory designs, these bytes should be set to hexadecimal zero zero, indicating no specific revision data is provided. The typical value shown for this field is hexadecimal zero zero zero zero, reflecting the standardized approach for embedded memory configurations.Bytes one hundred fifty through one hundred seventy five, spanning hexadecimal addresses ninety six through A F, are allocated as Manufacturer's Specific Data. This designated space allows module manufacturers to embed proprietary information beyond the standardized SPD fields. The typical value for these bytes is hexadecimal zero zero, though manufacturers may populate them with any additional data relevant to their specific module implementations. This provision ensures that manufacturers can convey specialized characteristics or configuration requirements while maintaining compatibility with standard SPD reading mechanisms.The final block of bytes, ranging from one hundred seventy six to two hundred fifty five and corresponding to hexadecimal addresses B zero through F F, is explicitly designated as Open for Customer Use. This allocation provides system integrators and end users with customizable storage space within the SPD structure. Like the manufacturer-specific bytes, this customer-use section typically contains hexadecimal zero zero values when unused, but can be programmed with custom configurations, serial numbers, or other module-specific metadata. This flexibility enables advanced feature implementation and system-specific optimizations at the module level, extending the utility of the SPD beyond basic memory parameter storage.The continuation byte mechanism employed in manufacturer identification reflects a common approach for handling variable-length data within fixed data structures, allowing for expanded addressability while maintaining backward compatibility. System memory controllers read this comprehensive SPD data during initialization, using the manufacturer ID for compatibility verification, the revision code for tracking design iterations, and the optional data fields for advanced configuration parameters. This systematic approach ensures reliable memory module operation across diverse computing platforms while preserving the extensibility needed for future enhancements and custom implementations.
