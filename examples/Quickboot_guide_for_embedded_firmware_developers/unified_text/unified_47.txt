The process of initializing Universal Serial Bus host controllers, specifically the Enhanced Host Controller Interface, or E H C I, requires a crucial detection process for any coexisting companion controllers, such as the Universal Host Controller Interface, or U H C I. This initial step ensures proper handoff or coexistence, particularly in systems that support both U S B one point zero or one point one, and U S B two point zero. Following this, the system must enumerate the connected U S B ports and ascertain their current connection status.Should any U S B devices or hubs be detected as physically connected to the root ports, a root port reset is initiated. This reset operation is time critical, designed to last for a specific, short duration. The brevity of this reset is deliberate, serving to suppress any potential resume signals that U S B devices might issue during their initialization phase. Such spurious signals, if not adequately suppressed, could lead to incorrect device states or enumeration failures. For the E H C I specification, the Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, is responsible for tracking the reset's duration and ensuring that the relevant status bit, indicating the completion of the reset, is cleared at the precisely stipulated time. In contrast, for the eXtensible Host Controller Interface, or X H C I, the controller itself manages this bit clearance, alleviating the B I O S of this responsibility, requiring only a polling mechanism.Upon completion of the reset sequence, the B I O S must actively poll for the port enable bit to be set, indicating that the U S B port has successfully transitioned to an enabled state and is ready for device communication. While the U S B specification typically mandates a maximum of two milliseconds for this completion, in actual implementations, particularly with Intel Platform Controller Hubs, or P C H s, this process often completes more rapidly, showcasing efficient hardware design. Following this, a critical phase of speed detection occurs. This involves the U S B host and the connected device negotiating the operational speed, whether it be low speed, full speed, or high speed, to ensure optimal data transfer rates.A subsequent reset operation might be performed, with a defined recovery timing of ten milliseconds. This delay ensures that the U S B bus and the connected devices have sufficient time to stabilize after the reset, preventing transient errors during subsequent communication. For an E H C I version, the system then proceeds to retrieve a descriptor from the connected device via the root port. This descriptor is a fundamental data structure in the U S B protocol, containing vital information about the device's type, capabilities, and configuration. Its acquisition is paramount for the host to properly identify and configure the connected hardware.There are two primary approaches when a U S B hub is connected. In the first approach, if the connected device is identified as a hub, the system configures it with a unique U S B address. This addressing is crucial for directed communication across the U S B bus. Following this, a pause of ten milliseconds is observed, as per U S B specification requirements. This delay might not be strictly necessary for all Intel components, but it is a robust protocol adherence. Additionally, any power on delays required for the hub to stabilize its internal circuitry must be accounted for. After these delays, each individual port on the newly configured hub is then configured. The second approach, applicable if the root port at index zero is identified as a hub, involves configuring this root hub and then proceeding to configure the U S B network downstream.It is strongly recommended that the B I O S initiate the enablement of all U S B root ports in parallel rather than sequentially. This concurrent enablement is a crucial optimization strategy designed to mitigate the cumulative effect of additive serial time delays. If enablement were performed sequentially, the total boot time and device availability would be significantly prolonged. By parallelizing this initial hardware configuration, the system can achieve a much faster and more efficient setup, allowing for deeper traversal and configuration of the U S B topology without incurring unnecessary latency.When the B I O S detects a U S B device, it first queries the device for its unique identifier, which is typically found within a device descriptor. This descriptor is a structured block of data providing fundamental information about the device's capabilities and type. Subsequent to obtaining this I D, the B I O S assigns a specific address to the U S B device, enabling it to communicate uniquely on the shared U S B bus. The depth of the interrogation and configuration process is contingent upon the device's type, often necessitating further queries to retrieve additional descriptors that detail its various interfaces and functional characteristics. This entire sequence of identification, addressing, and configuration is systematically repeated for each U S B root port present on the system, reflecting a platform level policy decision that dictates the specific enumeration strategy.Transitioning to storage controller technologies, Intel's evolution in supporting A T A controllers illustrates a significant paradigm shift from Parallel A T A, or P A T A, to Serial A T A, known as S A T A. While P A T A relied on wide, parallel data paths that were susceptible to signal integrity issues at higher speeds, S A T A adopted a more robust serial, point to point communication model, enhancing data transfer rates and simplifying cabling. Modern Intel platforms predominantly support S A T A controllers, often integrated directly into the chipset, providing a maximum of six S A T A ports. Nevertheless, older P A T A supported chipsets can still be encountered in the market, either as integrated components or as discrete P C I devices. Detailed specifications regarding the number and types of integrated controllers, their port configurations, and S A T A generation support are meticulously documented in Intel's datasheets, alongside comprehensive sets of programming registers that allow low level hardware interaction.S A T A controllers offer distinct programming interfaces, each representing a different level of abstraction and capability for interacting with storage devices. The legacy approach is known as A T A hyphen I D E Mode. This mode provides backward compatibility by using programming interfaces that mimic those of older I D E controllers. Within A T A hyphen I D E Mode, the system interacts with the controller either through standard task file I O registers or through P C I I D E Bus Master I O block registers. The task file approach involves direct C P U manipulation of memory mapped registers to issue commands and transfer data, a synchronous and less efficient method for contemporary high performance storage. P C I I D E Bus Master I O, while still using the I D E conceptual model for commands, introduces Direct Memory Access capabilities, allowing the controller to transfer data directly to and from system Ram without constant C P U intervention, thereby improving throughput.In contrast, the more advanced and widely adopted programming interface is the Advanced Host Controller Interface, or A H C I. Unlike the I D E modes, A H C I provides a standardized abstraction layer over the specific hardware implementation of S A T A controllers. This standardization is critical as it enables a single software driver to manage a wide array of A H C I compliant S A T A controllers from different manufacturers, reducing driver complexity and improving interoperability. The A H C I programming interface fundamentally relies on memory mapped register and buffer space. Instead of direct task file register manipulation, the host system constructs command lists and data structures in system memory, which the A H C I compliant controller then accesses and processes autonomously. This command list based model facilitates efficient, asynchronous command execution and enables advanced features such as Native Command Queuing, where multiple commands can be queued and processed by the drive itself in an optimized order, significantly enhancing I O performance and overall system responsiveness.The foundational process of initializing a Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, or S A T A, controller during the Power On Self Test, or P O S T, phase is critical for system stability and functionality. This initialization extends to resuming from deep power states, specifically System four slash System five, which represents a soft off or mechanical off state, and System three, which signifies suspend to Ram. Upon waking from a suspend to Ram state, the system's Basic I O System, or B I O S, assumes the crucial responsibility of meticulously restoring all S A T A controller registers to the exact states they held when the system initially booted and the controller was initialized during P O S T. This ensures seamless continuation of storage operations without data corruption or device recognition issues.The critical step in configuring the S A T A subsystem involves setting the S A T A controller mode. The B I O S must program this mode meticulously before any other initialization steps commence, or prior to any attempt to communicate with the attached storage drives. This prerequisite underscores the hierarchical nature of system boot, where lower level hardware configurations must be established before higher level software components can interact with the hardware. The S A T A controller mode is typically configured within mainstream Platform Controller Hubs, or P C H S. This is achieved by manipulating the S A T A Mode Select, or S M S, field located within a specific P C I configuration space register. For instance, the instruction indicates accessing Device thirty one, Function two, at offset hexadecimal nine zero, specifically targeting bits seven and six of that register. This precise addressing scheme is fundamental to the P C I Express, or P C I E, architecture, where each peripheral device has a designated configuration space allowing the B I O S or operating system to discover, identify, and configure its operational parameters.There are three modes that software could be operating in: A H C I, R A I D, and I D E compatible modes. Not every mode is supported on every component. Depending on the version of the component, whether it is mobile or desktop, and whether it is R A I D or non-R A I D, the allowed configurations vary. R A I D and A H C I modes require specific O S driver support and are identical except for differences in P I and C C dot S C C values. I D E mode does not have any special O S requirements and is sometimes termed compatible mode. In addition to the three operation modes mentioned, software can choose to operate S A T A ports under a single controller mode or dual controller mode. Software, typically the B I O S, decides up front which controller mode to use, based on the system's specific requirements and capabilities. This decision is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, compatibility, and functionality of the storage subsystem.
