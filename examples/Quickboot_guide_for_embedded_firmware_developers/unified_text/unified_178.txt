The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, specification for Double Data Rate three Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D D R three S D R A M, includes several fields that define critical memory timing parameters. One such parameter is the Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time, denoted as t F A W min, which is essential for ensuring stable operation of modern high-speed memory systems. The t F A W min parameter dictates the minimum time interval that must exist between consecutive Activate commands issued to a memory bank within a D D R S D R A M module.To determine the t F A W min value, one must consult the memory chip's datasheet and extract the relevant information. For instance, the Micron M T forty one J two hundred fifty six M eight S D R A M chip has a t F A W value of thirty seven point five nanoseconds, which varies depending on the part's page size. In this case, the page size is one K, as shown in the datasheet. The extracted t F A W value must then be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which is zero point one two five nanoseconds in this example. This division results in a value of three hundred, represented in hexadecimal as zero times one two C.The calculated t F A W min value is then stored in the S P D fields. Specifically, the upper nibble of the calculated value, zero times one, is placed into S P D Field number twenty eight, while the Least Significant Bits, zero times two C, are placed into S P D Field number twenty nine. This method of encoding timing parameters allows for a precise yet compact representation of critical memory performance characteristics within the S P D structure.The table outlining the S P D fields provides further insight into the definition and usage of the t F A W min parameter. Byte twenty nine, which contains the Least Significant Byte of the t F A W min value, is combined with the upper nibble of Byte twenty eight to form a twelve-bit value representing the Minimum Four Activate Window Delay Time in Medium Timebase units. The values for this timing parameter range from one to four thousand ninety five M T B units, and the Medium Timebase unit is a fundamental clock period used to express various timing parameters in S D R A M.The provided examples illustrate the relationship between t F A W, Timebase, and t F A W Result for different D D R three memory configurations. For instance, a t F A W of three hundred twenty M T B units with a Timebase of zero point one two five nanoseconds results in a t F A W Result of forty nanoseconds, used as an example for D D R three dash eight hundred with a one K B page size. Similarly, a t F A W of two hundred sixteen M T B units with a Timebase of zero point one two five nanoseconds results in a t F A W Result of twenty seven nanoseconds, used as an example for D D R three dash one eight six six with a one K B page size.Understanding and configuring these timing parameters is crucial for the memory controller to correctly interact with the D D R S D R A M. Incorrectly set timing parameters can lead to unpredictable behavior, memory errors, and system instability. Therefore, these values are carefully specified by memory manufacturers and must be adhered to by system designers. The S P D specification provides a standardized framework for encoding and interpreting these critical timing parameters, ensuring reliable operation of high-speed memory systems.
