The calculation of Write Recovery time is a crucial aspect of memory timing, particularly in the context of DDR3 memory. To determine the appropriate Write Recovery time, the system's Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, follows a three-step process. Firstly, the B I O S identifies the common operating frequency for all memory modules installed in the system, ensuring that the corresponding value of t C K, t C K actual, falls within a specified range defined by t C K min and t C K max. If t C K actual deviates from a J E D E C standard value, the B I O S selects the next smaller standard t C K min value for calculating Write Recovery.The B I O S then calculates the "desired" Write Recovery, denoted as W R desired, using the formula: W R desired equals the ceiling of t W R min divided by t C K actual. The ceiling function mandates that the result of the division be rounded up to the nearest whole number, ensuring a sufficient recovery period for successful write operations. The context provided states that t W R min is defined in Byte seventeen, implying a specific memory register or configuration setting that holds this value.Subsequently, the B I O S determines the "actual" Write Recovery, W R actual, by taking the maximum of W R desired and the minimum Write Recovery supported by the memory, referred to as min W R supported. This step ensures that the chosen Write Recovery time adheres to the capabilities of the installed memory. The minimum W R supported represents the lowest acceptable Write Recovery timing value that the D D R three S D Rams can reliably operate with. By taking the maximum, the system selects a timing that satisfies both the calculated need for recovery based on current operating conditions and the fundamental operational limits of the hardware.A usage example for D D R three-one three three three G operating at D D R three-one three three three speeds illustrates this process. Given t C K actual equals one point five nanoseconds, W R desired is calculated as fifteen divided by one point five, resulting in ten. Consequently, W R actual is determined as the maximum of ten and ten, yielding ten. This example demonstrates how the system adapts Write Recovery timing based on the memory's operating conditions and specifications.The provided table, titled "Table Fifty-six Electrical Characteristics and A C Operating Conditions," presents a detailed breakdown of timing parameters for various D D R three memory speeds, including D D R three-eight hundred, D D R three-one zero six six, D D R three-one three three three, and D D R three-one six hundred. The table includes parameters such as D Q S, D Q S# differential R E A D postamble, identified by the symbol 'R P S T', with minimum and maximum values specified in nanoseconds or as notes indicating other dependencies.Under the "Command and Address Timings" section, several critical timing parameters are enumerated, including the D L L locking time, which is five hundred twelve clock cycles across all specified D D R three speeds. The setup and hold times for control, command, and address signals relative to the clock and its complement are also specified, with variations across different D D R three standards. For instance, the 'I S' parameter, representing the setup time for address and command signals to the clock, exhibits minimum values of one hundred twenty-five picoseconds for D D R three-one zero six six and sixty-five picoseconds for D D R three-one three three three.The table further details the minimum pulse width for control, command, and address signals, denoted by 'I P W', and the delay from an A C T I V A T E command to an internal R E A D or W R I T E command, referred to as 'R C D'. The 'I P W' parameter shows minimum values ranging from nine hundred picoseconds for D D R three-eight hundred down to six hundred twenty picoseconds for D D R three-one three three three. For the 'R C D' parameter, the table indicates that users should refer to Speed Bin Tables, with a unit of nanoseconds.Additional command timings are specified, including the P R E C H A R G E command period, A C T I V A T E to P R E C H A R G E command period, and A C T I V A T E to A C T I V A T E command period. These timings are categorized by page size, with minimum values defined as the greater of specific clock cycles or nanoseconds. The write recovery time, R E A D to P R E C H A R G E time, C A S# to C A S# command delay, and Auto precharge write recovery plus precharge time are also specified, with minimum values calculated based on clock cycles or nanoseconds.The S P D Field number seventeen, titled "Minimum Write Recovery Time (t W R min)," is an example from the Micron M T forty-one J two five six M eight Datasheet. S P D Field zero times twelve R A S# to C A S# delay, also known as t R C D min, must also be extracted from the datasheet and divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor. These parameters are fundamental to ensuring reliable data transfer and signal integrity in high-speed memory systems, reflecting the complex interplay between clocking, data strobes, command signals, and memory controller operations. The variations in these timings across different memory speeds highlight the design trade-offs and engineering challenges involved in achieving higher data rates.
