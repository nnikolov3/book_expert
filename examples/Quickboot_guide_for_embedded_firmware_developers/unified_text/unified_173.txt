The Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or SDRAM, chip's operational constraints and performance characteristics are heavily influenced by its timing parameters. Two key timing specifications are SPD Field twenty-three, representing the "Minimum Active to Active/Refresh Delay Time," denoted as tRCmin, and SPD Field zero times eighteen and zero times nineteen, which corresponds to the "Minimum Refresh Recovery Delay," or tRFCmin. These fields are crucial for understanding the minimum time intervals between different memory access operations, ensuring data integrity and system stability.The extraction of tRFCmin involves a calculation where the value found in the datasheet is divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor. For instance, in the Micron MT41J256M8-187E datasheet, the tRFC value is one hundred sixty nanoseconds. This value is then divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which is zero point one two five nanoseconds, resulting in a value of twelve hundred eighty, or zero x zero five zero zero in hexadecimal. The least significant bits, or LSB, of this result go into SPD Field twenty-four, while the most significant bits, or MSB, go into SPD Field twenty-five.The contents of Byte twenty-four and Byte twenty-five combined create a sixteen-bit value that defines the minimum SDRAM Refresh Recovery Time Delay in Medium Timebase, or MTB, units. The most significant bit is Bit seven of Byte twenty-five, and the least significant bit is Bit zero of Byte twenty-four. These values come from the DDR3 SDRAM datasheet and are used to determine the minimum refresh recovery delay. The range of values for tRFCmin in MTB units is from one to sixty-five thousand five hundred thirty-five.Examples provided in a table illustrate the relationship between tRFC in MTB units, the corresponding timebase in nanoseconds, and the resulting tRFC value in nanoseconds, along with its typical use case, such as memory density. For instance, a tRFC of seven hundred twenty MTB units, with a timebase of zero point one two five nanoseconds, results in a tRFC of ninety nanoseconds and is typically used with five hundred twelve megabyte memory modules. As the tRFC in MTB units increases, the corresponding tRFC in nanoseconds also increases, correlating with larger memory capacities.The JEDEC DDR3 SPD Specification defines these timing parameters to ensure interoperability among different memory modules. Understanding these parameters is crucial for memory controller design and ensuring stable operation of memory subsystems. The specification outlines various timing parameters, including refresh timing, write recovery time, and self-refresh timing, which are essential for proper SDRAM initialization and operation.In addition to the tRFCmin parameter, other timing parameters are specified, such as the refresh command period, maximum refresh period, and maximum average periodic refresh. These parameters are dependent on factors like memory size and temperature. For example, the refresh command period for a one-gigabyte memory module has a minimum of one hundred ten clock cycles and a maximum of seventy thousand two hundred clock cycles. The maximum refresh period and maximum average periodic refresh are also specified, with temperatures less than or equal to eighty-five degrees Celsius having different values than those greater than eighty-five degrees Celsius.The write recovery time and delay from start of internal write transaction to internal read command are also defined, with minimum values specified in nanoseconds and clock cycles, respectively. The self-refresh timing section includes parameters related to exiting self-refresh modes, with minimum values specified in terms of the system clock or tRFC plus ten nanoseconds.Overall, the timing parameters of an SDRAM chip, as defined by the JEDEC DDR3 SPD Specification, play a critical role in ensuring the reliable operation of memory subsystems. By understanding these parameters and their relationships, designers can create memory controllers that optimize performance while maintaining data integrity and system stability. The specification provides a comprehensive framework for designing and implementing SDRAM modules, enabling the development of high-performance computing systems that meet the demands of modern applications.
