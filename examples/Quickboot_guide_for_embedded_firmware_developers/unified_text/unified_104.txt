The design of a platform's firmware, particularly in the context of booting and initializing hardware components, is a complex process that involves balancing functionality, compatibility, and performance. A key concept in this domain is the "platform policy zone," where designers must make informed decisions about how and when various components are used, taking into account factors such as the presence or absence of integrated components like a R A I D controller. This decision-making process is dynamic, allowing for adaptations based on the specific requirements and constraints of the platform.In the context of boot time reductions, it is essential to determine what tasks can be offloaded from the B I O S space to the operating system space. For instance, if the O S kernel or drivers are capable of repeating the bus and device enumeration of the entire P C I subsystem, for S A T A or U S B hubs and devices, then the B I O S only needs to perform the necessary tasks to get the O S loaded and executing, skipping the rest. This approach can significantly reduce boot time, as it eliminates the need for the B I O S to handle numerous "inane corner cases" that are often present in standard P C B I O S implementations for the sake of ultimate backward compatibility.The prevalence of legacy support in standard P C B I O S implementations is a notable aspect of platform design. Many B I O S implementations handle a wide range of legacy devices and scenarios, often at the cost of increased complexity and overhead. This extensive legacy support is driven by the desire to ensure that older software and hardware continue to function on modern systems, even if those functions are not actively used. However, this approach can introduce significant overhead, particularly in the context of fast boot times.Developers are encouraged to adopt a "reduce, reduce, reduce" approach when it comes to fast boot times. This involves carefully evaluating the necessity of various features and components, and eliminating or simplifying them wherever possible. For example, if a user can connect a device via U S B, but the platform does not support booting from that device, then the B I O S can avoid initializing the U S B infrastructure, saving valuable time during the boot process.A good general performance optimization statement is: "If you can put off doing something in B I O S that the O S can do, then put it off." This principle highlights the importance of offloading tasks from firmware to the operating system, where possible, to simplify firmware and potentially speed up the boot process. However, this approach requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between firmware and O S initialization, as well as a deep understanding of the entire boot chain, including the bootloader, potential second-stage agents, the O S, and shutdown procedures.The management of P C I resources is another critical aspect of platform design. Assigning these resources to U S B controllers, for example, can have significant implications for system performance and boot time. By eliminating B I O S U S B enumeration, developers can potentially reallocate or reduce the overhead associated with these resources, further contributing to optimization.In the context of U S B devices, the operating system plays a crucial role in initializing and configuring these devices during the boot process. The O S drivers will normally reset the U S B controllers and re-enumerate the U S B bus and devices to suit its own needs, which can take significant time. This process is essential for ensuring that all peripherals are correctly initialized and ready for use, but it can also introduce delays and overhead.Platform policy ultimately affects how an engineer responds to the remaining questions and challenges in platform design. By carefully evaluating the trade-offs between functionality, compatibility, and performance, designers can create optimized platforms that meet the needs of users while minimizing boot times and overhead. This requires a deep understanding of the entire boot chain, as well as the ability to make informed decisions about how and when various components are used.Case studies have demonstrated the importance of careful platform design and optimization. For example, a one point eight Ghz Intel Atom T M based netbook design with one G B D D R two memory and two M B flash can achieve significant reductions in boot time by applying optimized platform policies and reducing unnecessary overhead. By measuring performance numbers in microseconds and total boot time in seconds, developers can gain valuable insights into the bottlenecks and areas for improvement in the boot process.In conclusion, the design of a platform's firmware is a complex and nuanced process that requires careful consideration of functionality, compatibility, and performance. By adopting a "reduce, reduce, reduce" approach, offloading tasks from firmware to the operating system, and carefully managing P C I resources, developers can create optimized platforms that meet the needs of users while minimizing boot times and overhead. Ultimately, platform policy plays a critical role in determining the performance and functionality of a system, and designers must be aware of the trade-offs and challenges involved in creating fast, efficient, and compatible platforms.
