The optimization of computer systems is a multifaceted endeavor, encompassing various aspects such as interface and device access, processor performance, and memory subsystems. A critical area of focus is the Direct Media Interface, or DMI, which is a point-to-point serial interface used to connect Intel chipsets. The DMI plays a pivotal role in minimizing input/output latency between the Platform Controller Hub, or PCH, and onboard devices. To achieve this, it is essential to utilize the highest available DMI link speed, as the default speed may not be optimal. The system's Basic Input Output System, or BIOS, should enable the highest DMI link speed, such as Generation 2, which offers a speed of five gigatransfers per second, as early as possible during the SEC phase, provided that this does not conflict with hardware design constraints.The benefits of a faster DMI link are noteworthy, as it can improve input/output configuration speed by an estimated six to fourteen percent. However, it is also important to consider the concept of "predictable survivability," which suggests that while operating at maximum speed is desirable, there may be scenarios or hardware configurations where the DMI link may not be able to sustain its top speeds reliably throughout the entire boot process. Consequently, the option to control the DMI link speed, potentially setting it to a lower, more stable speed during the initial boot, and then retraining to the higher speed later, is presented as a strategy to balance performance and system stability.In addition to DMI optimizations, processor performance is another critical aspect of system optimization. Starting with the Sandy Bridge CPU architecture, introduced around two thousand ten, the CPU frequency at reset is limited to the lowest supported frequency to ensure a stable startup. To enable dynamic performance state transitioning, a predefined list of registers must be configured in a precise order. This configuration is crucial for the functionality known as Intel Fast Boot, which involves saving necessary register settings in the UEFI Variables protocol during a full boot and restoring them during a fast boot to enable performance state transitioning.The process of streamlining CPU reset and initial CPU microcode update is also essential for efficient system startup. This involves a sequence of events, including zeroing the CPU timestamp counter, completing DMI initialization, performing soft strap and dynamic fusing of the CPU, reading the CPU patch microcode from the SPI flash, updating all logical processors within the CPU package, and starting the execution of the BIOS at the reset vector. Each of these steps is critical for ensuring a correct and efficient system startup, with particular attention paid to the timing and dependencies between various initialization steps.Furthermore, efficient initialization of application processors, or APs, is vital in multicore, multithreaded CPUs. The BIOS needs to replicate memory range and other CPU settings for all APs, and guidelines for optimization include parallelizing microcode updating and other operations, minimizing synchronization overhead, and executing from memory rather than from the SPI flash. Caching code and data is also crucial, as all BIOS code must be executed in a cache-enabled state, and data should be stored in the cache to minimize access latency.Lastly, the main memory subsystem is a critical component of the system, and its optimization is essential for overall performance. The memory configuration complexity must be carefully managed to ensure efficient data transfer and processing. By optimizing these various aspects of the system, including DMI, processor performance, AP initialization, caching, and memory subsystems, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in overall system efficiency and responsiveness.
