The J E D E C S P D, or Serial Presence Detect, specification is a crucial mechanism for enabling system memory configuration and initialization. For version one point zero of the specification, certain fields are designated as reserved and are expected to be set to a value of zero, represented numerically as hexadecimal zero zero. However, for J E D E C S P D version one point one, a subset of these fields has been defined for specific purposes. A table presented outlines the mapping of byte ranges to their corresponding fields, typical values, and definitions. Specifically, bytes thirty four through fifty nine are designated as reserved in the context of version one point zero, with a typical value of hexadecimal zero zero.For version one point one, these bytes are programmed differently. Byte thirty four provides a fine offset for the S D R A M Minimum Cycle Time, denoted as t C K min. This byte functions as a modifier for the calculation of S P D byte twelve, often referred to as the Master Timing Bank, or M T B, units. The value of t C K min is sourced from the S D R A M datasheet and is represented as a Two's Complement multiplier for F T B units, ranging from plus one hundred twenty seven to minus one hundred twenty eight. Further details on this Two's Complement encoding can be found by referencing the section on relating the M T B and F T B.Similarly, byte thirty five is defined as a fine offset for the Minimum C A S Latency Time, or t A A min. This byte influences the calculation of S P D byte sixteen, which is also part of the M T B units. The value of t A A min is obtained from the S D R A M datasheet and serves as a Two's Complement multiplier for F T B units, with a range similar to t C K min, from plus one hundred twenty seven to minus one hundred twenty eight. Examples and further context for this encoding are available in S P D byte sixteen, under the discussion of relating the M T B and F T B.Byte thirty six addresses the fine offset for the Minimum R A S hash to C A S hash Delay Time, also known as t R C D min. This byte is instrumental in modifying the calculation of S P D byte eighteen, which is part of the M T B units. The value of t R C D min is derived from the S D R A M datasheet and, like the previous examples, acts as a Two's Complement multiplier for F T B units, ranging from plus one hundred twenty seven to minus one hundred twenty eight. Byte thirty seven defines the Minimum Row Precharge Delay Time, denoted as t R P min, which modifies the calculation of S P D byte twenty, also in M T B units. The value of t R P min comes from the S D R A M datasheet and is represented as a Two's Complement multiplier for F T B units, with the same range as before.Byte thirty eight represents the Fine Offset for Minimum Active to Active/Refresh Delay Time, or t R C min, modifying the values of S P D bytes twenty one and twenty three, which are in M T B units. The value of t R C min, obtained from the S D R A M datasheet, is subject to the same Two's Complement encoding, spanning the range from plus one hundred twenty seven to minus one hundred twenty eight. The document then transitions to a broader "Module Specific Section," encompassing bytes sixty through one hundred sixteen, dedicated to S P D bytes particular to D D R three memory module families. Module Type Key Byte three serves as an index to govern the encoding of the subsequent bytes in this range, with their content detailed across multiple appendices, each dedicated to a particular memory module family.S P D Field number sixty pertains to the "Module Nominal Height," a definition sourced from the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification, providing a standardized measurement for the physical dimensions of the memory module. This field is defined for unbuffered modules, with down-on-board memory designs setting this field to zero x zero zero. The byte defines the nominal height in millimeters of the fully assembled module, including heat spreaders or other added components, with references to J E D E C J C eleven module outline documents for dimension definitions. The encoding of this field involves bits seven through five being reserved, while bits four through zero represent the Module Nominal Height max in millimeters, with a baseline height of fifteen millimeters. The encoding scheme allows for various height ranges to be specified, from less than fifteen millimeters to forty five millimeters or more, providing a detailed and standardized way to describe the physical attributes of memory modules.
