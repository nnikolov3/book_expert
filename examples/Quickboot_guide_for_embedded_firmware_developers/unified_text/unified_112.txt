The organization and dispatch of firmware volumes, or FVs, within the context of a Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, is a critical aspect of system performance. FVs are logically grouped collections, and their association with specific drivers is dependent on their phase of operation or function. The dispatching of a driver, which involves loading it from memory, typically from flash storage, can be influenced by the presence of a connected device. Platform policy dictates how the device execution, or D X E, core interacts with these drivers. For instance, if a Universal Serial Bus, or U S B, device boot is not required, then the U S B related drivers, along with their associated firmware volumes, would not be dispatched. This illustrates a form of conditional loading and execution based on system state and configuration, a common practice in embedded systems and operating system kernels for optimizing resource utilization and startup time.A key principle highlighted is the minimization of resources, specifically focusing on I O, or Input Output, operations. The flash memory where the B I O S is stored is identified as a particularly slow I O resource. Therefore, reducing the amount of data stored in the B I O S flash translates to a direct benefit: the less space occupied, the faster routines within the B I O S can access and read content. This optimization can involve loading critical data into faster memory tiers, such as Ram. The strategy for achieving this space reduction is through driver pruning, which is the selective removal or optimization of drivers that are not essential for the platform's operation, often guided by marketing requirements or specific platform functionalities. This approach is rooted in performance engineering principles, where identifying and mitigating performance bottlenecks, especially those related to slow storage access, is paramount for overall system responsiveness.The performance analysis reveals that several configurations can significantly impact boot time. For example, turning off debugging results in a boot time of eight point three nine seconds, compared to eleven point six six seconds for the initial configuration, yielding an improvement of three point two seven seconds. Decreasing flash size leads to a boot time of eight point one eight seconds, with an incremental improvement of zero point two one seconds. Caching of P E I phase results in a boot time of seven point nine one seconds, with an improvement of zero point two seven seconds. Intel SpeedStep technology enabled early shows a boot time of seven point eight zero seconds, with a minimal improvement of zero point zero nine seconds. B D S optimization for boot devices has a boot time of seven point five three seconds, with an improvement of zero point two nine seconds. Platform memory speed is at seven point four three seconds, with a comparable value of zero point one zero seconds. Removing P S slash two keyboard slash mouse results in a boot time of seven point three five seconds, with an improvement of zero point zero seven seconds. Removing B I O S setup shows a significant improvement, with a boot time of five point four three seconds, and an improvement of one point nine three seconds. Removing the video option R O M has a boot time of three point three three seconds, with an improvement of two point one zero seconds. Finally, removing B I O S U S B support has the most substantial impact, with a boot time of one point six five seconds, and an improvement of one point six eight seconds.The process of turning off debugging removes serial debugging information and enables C compiler optimizations. Since framework B I O S is almost entirely written in C, enabling compiler optimizations is particularly useful. However, in production environments, this debugging information can be eliminated to improve performance. Decreasing flash size involves modifying the B I O S build process to use a smaller flash part, which improves access time by reducing the number of flash blocks used. Caching of P E I phase takes advantage of the Intel Atom processor's ability to enable cache-as-Ram plus a sixty-four K B region of normally cached address space. By arranging the B I O S to utilize this cacheable region for P E I modules executed prior to memory initialization, performance is increased. These optimizations demonstrate the importance of careful system configuration and tuning to achieve optimal performance, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
