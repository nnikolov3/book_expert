The collaborative roles of hardware, firmware, and software in achieving a fast boot experience are vital to the overall performance of a system. As Lucius Annaeus Seneca once stated, "Every sin is the result of a collaboration," which sets the stage for understanding the importance of coordination between these system components. To achieve a sub-second initialization time, a benchmark for a "Fast Boot" experience, a holistic approach is necessary, where hardware, firmware, and software operate in concert. If the hardware platform is incapable of supporting rapid startup, or if the firmware is not sufficiently optimized, then investments in software optimization for faster booting may be inefficient or even wasted.The power hardware role is a critical aspect of the boot process, as hundreds of milliseconds can elapse before the first instruction set is executed. This initial hardware bring-up phase, often managed by low-level firmware or microcode, must be meticulously crafted to minimize latency. The efficiency and design of power-on and reset mechanisms directly impact the overall boot duration, illustrating the fundamental role of hardware in enabling or hindering fast boot performance. Power sequencing, in particular, can introduce delays, with simplified power plans potentially merging the Manageability Engine's power plane with other devices, resulting in an additional seventy milliseconds of delay.The power supply specification is another crucial factor, as the presence of a Personal Computer, or P C, A T power supply can introduce a one hundred millisecond delay to the system's boot process. This delay is often attributed to the execution of add-in card onboard firmware. For systems incorporating an embedded controller, such as a mobile client or an all-in-one desktop, an additional delay can stem from power button debounce logic implemented within the embedded controller firmware, which can extend the startup latency by as much as one hundred milliseconds.The flash subsystem is also essential, with the recommendation to employ the highest speed Serial Peripheral Interface, or S P I, flash components that are compatible with the system's chipset. Utilizing an S P I chip with a slower clock frequency, such as thirty-three megahertz, can significantly increase system boot time, potentially by as much as fifty percent when compared to systems employing a fifty megahertz S P I component. Furthermore, the efficiency of data transfer is impacted by the read method, with single-byte reads generally being less performant than multiple-byte reads. Consequently, designers are advised to opt for components with at least a fifty megahertz clock frequency to optimize boot times and data access speeds.Series six and seven chipsets support fifty megahertz DOFR, which stands for Dual Output Fast Read, and there are also components that will support Quad Fast Read. As the S P I interface is normally a bottleneck on boot speed, this small change can mean a lot to overall performance, and it is a relatively small difference on the bill of material. Besides configuring for faster read access and prefetch enabling, further optimizations can be done to reduce flash component accesses. For example, BIOS option setup data could be a few kilobytes in size, and each time a setup option is referenced, it could cost about one millisecond for thirty-three megahertz S P I, with several references potentially occurring.Optimization can also be achieved by reinstalling the read-only variable P P I with a new version, which has a copy of the setup data in C A R memory, thus reducing the need for repeated S P I accesses. Additionally, caching setup data in memory for S three needs can prevent unnecessary S P I access during S three resume. Enabling the buffers on the components to prefetch data from the flash device is also possible, with the recommendation to set up S P I Prefetch as early as the S E C phase. Performance profiling is advised to compare prefetch-enabled boot time of each of the individual U E F I modules and determine potential impact, particularly during the time when firmware volumes are shadowed.
