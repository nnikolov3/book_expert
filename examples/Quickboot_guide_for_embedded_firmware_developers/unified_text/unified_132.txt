The process of initializing a computer system involves several critical components and protocols that must work in harmony to ensure efficient and reliable operation. One such aspect is the provisioning of Intel Active Management Technology, or Intel AMT, via a USB flash drive. In systems that adhere to the Fast Boot framework, USB flash drive provisioning for Intel AMT is only supported in full boot mode. This distinction is crucial because certain exceptions, classified as type two or type three, can cause the system to fall back into full boot mode, potentially affecting the provisioning process. For instance, if a user interrupts the boot process by pressing a hot key, an exception is triggered, and if this occurs during the Boot Device Selection phase in full boot mode, Intel AMT provisioning via a USB stick may not function as expected.In addition to the boot process, the graphics subsystem plays a vital role in system initialization. The choice and performance of graphics hardware are influenced by factors such as panel timings and controller timing and speed. A UEFI Graphics Output Protocol driver can provide faster boot speeds than a legacy video BIOS, and a single graphics solution will generally boot faster than a multiple display or controller configuration. The Graphics Output Protocol, or GOP, is particularly significant in systems that support a CSM-free boot, where the GOP driver is loaded by the BIOS instead of the CSM legacy video option ROM, eliminating the time spent on creating legacy VGA mode display services.The benefits of using a GOP driver are evident in the reduced initialization times for various display interfaces, including CRT, DisplayPort, Embedded DisplayPort, HDMI, and LVDS. For example, the initialization time for an Embedded DisplayPort panel can be significantly reduced by optimizing the power sequencing and timing parameters. However, industry specifications may mandate specific startup times, such as the two hundred fifty millisecond startup time for an Embedded DisplayPort panel, which can be a substantial delay in the boot process.To mitigate such delays, it is essential to start the panel power-up sequence early, similar to disk drives, to parallelize the delays in hardware initialization. A PEI module can be used to power up the Embedded DisplayPort panel, ensuring that it is ready for use before the video module is reached in the BIOS phase. This approach highlights the importance of concurrency and dependency management in system initialization, where multiple hardware components must be synchronized to ensure efficient and reliable operation.The storage subsystem is another critical component in system initialization, with spinning media storage devices requiring a minimum of two seconds to spin up. Even if the BIOS starts initialization shortly after gaining control of the system, the drive may not be ready to provide an operating system. To optimize storage subsystem access, the BIOS should utilize non-blocking storage I/O, such as Nonblocking Command Queuing, or NCQ, in native AHCI mode operation, unless required by the target operating system. For instance, in all Windows operating systems since Windows XP, AHCI mode should be the default SATA storage mode, ensuring efficient and reliable data transfer.In conclusion, the initialization of a computer system involves a complex interplay of components and protocols, including Intel AMT provisioning, graphics subsystems, and storage subsystems. By understanding the critical aspects of system initialization, such as boot modes, graphics protocols, and storage access methods, developers and system designers can create more efficient, reliable, and responsive computing systems.
