The system under consideration utilizes an Intel SCH US15W chipset with a D1 stepping, indicating a specific revision of the chipset's integrated platform controller hub. This chipset manages various I/O functions, communication between components, and power management. The system is equipped with five hundred twelve megabytes of D Ram, operating at four hundred megahertz, a standard for DDR2 memory, which provides the primary working memory for the C P U. Additionally, two megabytes of flash memory are present, typically used for storing firmware such as the basic input/output system, or BIOS, or the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, UEFI, and potentially other non-volatile configuration data.The performance analysis reveals that the system's boot time can be significantly improved through optimization. Table ten point two presents a comparative analysis of system boot performance, detailing a "Normal Boot Time" and an "Optimized Boot Time," along with the "Delta" or difference between them and the "Percentage Reduction in Boot Times." The total boot time under normal conditions is eleven point sixty six seconds. Through optimization, this time is reduced to one point sixty five seconds, resulting in a delta of ten point zero one seconds. This significant reduction translates to an eighty five point eight five percent improvement. The accompanying text notes that while a diverse set of techniques were employed, the optimization effort was particularly focused on embedded market scenarios, aiming for substantial boot time reduction.Further analysis of the boot time improvements is provided in Table ten point three, which breaks down the effects of specific changes. The "Initial configuration" serves as the baseline, with a boot time of nine point sixty five seconds and no incremental improvement recorded. Eliminating SMBIOS tables, a process that involves removing or simplifying the system management BIOS data structure, reduces the boot time by zero point four seconds, bringing the total to nine point twenty five seconds. Booting to a UEFI target, which signifies a transition from legacy BIOS to the more modern UEFI firmware, further decreases the boot time by zero point five seconds, achieving a total of eight point seventy five seconds. The most substantial improvement is observed when using UEFI drivers instead of option ROMs, which are typically legacy code drivers for hardware devices. This change results in an incremental improvement of three point zero seconds, leading to a significantly faster boot time of five point seventy five seconds.The concept of "boot time" itself refers to the sequence of operations executed by the system's firmware and operating system to initialize hardware, load the OS kernel, and bring the system to an operational state. Each phase of this process, from power on to user interaction readiness, contributes to the total boot duration. The optimizations shown are typical techniques employed to streamline this critical initialization sequence, particularly in embedded systems where rapid startup is often a key requirement. For instance, using an SSD versus HDD to eliminate spin-up time can yield significant improvements, with metrics of three point sixty five and two point one, respectively. Using UEFI services results in a metric of three point forty compared to zero point twenty five, while removing the setup menu presents data for a metric of one point ninety nine versus one point forty one.The interplay between marketing requirements and engineering realities is also highlighted. While marketing directives may initially focus on optimizing for performance, the actual technical implementation is often constrained by these very requirements. Answering basic questions, such as what are the design goals and what are the supported target operating systems, can help guide decision-making and define system performance characteristics. The engineering responses to marketing requirements do not always involve a broad spectrum of code optimization techniques. Instead, significant improvements in boot speed can be achieved by adhering to specific guidelines rather than relying on complex or potentially buggy code optimizations. These guidelines are described as being "codebase independent tricks," implying a focus on fundamental principles and architectural decisions.Understanding the requirements of a particular platform-supported OS will greatly affect what optimization paths can be taken in the BIOS. Since many "open" platforms have a wide variety of operating systems that they support, this limits some of the choices available. In the case of the proof-of-concept platform, there were only two main operating systems that were required to be supported. This enabled the author to make a few choices that allowed the codebase to save roughly four hundred milliseconds of boot time by avoiding the reading of some of the DIMM SPD data for creating certain SMBIOS records since they weren't used by the target operating systems. Changes in the BIOS codebase that avoided the unnecessary creation of certain tables saved roughly four hundred milliseconds in the boot time.The consideration of legacy operating systems and option ROMs is also crucial. If all the OS targets are UEFI-compliant, then the platform can save roughly zero point five second in initialization of the video option ROM. However, in cases where both UEFI-compliant and non-compliant operating systems need to be supported, the platform BIOS must execute the compatibility segment module, which can introduce additional overhead. The variety of tricks that could have been achieved by the platform BIOS when booting the UEFI-compliant OS are limited by the need to support legacy operating systems, highlighting the importance of careful design choices in platform development.
