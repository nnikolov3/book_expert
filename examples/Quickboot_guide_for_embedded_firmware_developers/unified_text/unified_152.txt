The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard is a crucial mechanism for memory modules to self-describe their capabilities to a host system. Within this standard, specific fields are designated to convey essential information about the memory module's characteristics. One such field is S P D Field hex zero six, which is designated for the Nominal Voltage, V D D, of the memory component. This field is vital for ensuring compatibility and proper operation of the memory module with the host system's power delivery capabilities.The Nominal Voltage parameter is extracted directly from the S D R A M datasheet, usually on the front page. This byte, Byte six, describes the voltage level, V D D, which is fundamental for the operation of components like D Ram. The text clarifies that the S P D supply and thermal sensor components are not directly affected by this specific byte's content. A critical concept introduced here is "Operable" voltage, defined as the V D D voltage at which the module's operation is permitted, based on the performance values programmed within the S P D. Furthermore, an "Endurant" voltage is defined as the V D D voltage at which the module can be powered without negatively impacting its operational lifespan or overall reliability.The table presented illustrates a single byte of data, Byte six, which corresponds to hexadecimal zero x zero six. This byte is identified by the field name "Nominal Voltage, V D D" and has a typical value of zero x zero zero, with a definition indicating "one point five volt only". The accompanying text elaborates on the significance of Byte six, explaining that it serves to describe the voltage level, V D D, which is fundamental for the operation of components like D Ram. This information might be stored in a register, if applicable.In addition to the Nominal Voltage, another crucial aspect of S D Ram modules is their organization, which is described by S P D Field zero x zero seven, titled "Ranks & Device D Q Count". This byte is crucial for describing the module's organization, specifically the number of ranks and the data width of the individual S D Ram devices. A rank is a block of memory chips on a module that can be accessed independently. The data presented in this table shows that for Byte seven, the field name is "Ranks & Device DQ Count". The typical value for this field is hexadecimal zero x zero one, which is defined as indicating a Rank of one and a device width of times eight, often represented as x eight.The S D Ram device width can also be easily discerned by looking at the schematics and noting the number of data lines used by each S D Ram device. S D Ram devices use four, eight, sixteen, or thirty-two data signals. The Number of Ranks is trickier to calculate, as this parameter is not associated with the S D Ram chips, but is a parameter relating to the D I M M itself. It is the number of rank signals or chip selects used in the D I M M equivalent. The proper value to use must be extracted from the schematics, noting the specific chip select pins being used on a given channel. If only C S zero is routed to the S D Ram chips, then the down-on-board memory solution is single rank, meaning one rank. If both C S zero and C S one are routed to all of the S D Ram chips, the down-on-board memory solution is dual rank, meaning two ranks. Some server chipsets also support quad-rank D I M M s.The encoding of the Module Minimum Nominal Voltage, V D D, using bits two through zero, is also critical. This voltage parameter is crucial for ensuring compatibility and proper operation of the memory module with the host system's power delivery capabilities. The table indicates that a three-bit field is used to represent various voltage levels, with specific bit combinations mapping to distinct operating voltages such as one point two five volt, one point three five volt, and one point five volt. The definitions also highlight operational characteristics like "operable" or "endurant", suggesting different levels of voltage tolerance or power saving modes. Notably, Bit zero uses an inverted polarity for backward compatibility with prior generations of S D Ram.In conclusion, the S P D standard provides essential information about the memory module's characteristics, including the Nominal Voltage and the organization of the S D Ram devices. Understanding these parameters is crucial for ensuring compatibility and proper operation of the memory module with the host system. The encoding of the Module Minimum Nominal Voltage, V D D, and the description of the S D Ram device width and number of ranks, are all vital aspects of the S P D standard that must be carefully considered when designing and implementing memory systems.
