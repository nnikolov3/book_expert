The presented data characterizes timing parameters for D D R three to one O six six speed bin, specifically for C L-R C D-R P settings of seven dash seven dash seven and eight dash eight dash eight. These bins represent different performance grades of the memory chips, influenced by factors such as manufacturing process variations and testing. The table delineates critical timing parameters, measured in nanoseconds, which are fundamental to the synchronous operation of dynamic random-access memory.The parameters listed are essential for ensuring correct data retrieval and command execution within a memory subsystem. Specifically, R C D, t R P, and t R C represent various latency periods associated with memory operations. R C D, or the A C T I V A T E to internal R E A D or W R I T E delay time, signifies the duration required for the memory array to become ready to accept a read or write command after an A C T I V A T E command has been issued to a specific row. The minimum value for the minus one eight seven E bin is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds, with a maximum not specified, while the minus one eight seven bin mandates a minimum of fifteen nanoseconds.t R P, the P R E C H A R G E command period, dictates the minimum time that must elapse between issuing a P R E C H A R G E command to a row and issuing an A C T I V A T E command to any row. This timing is crucial for the internal state of the memory bank to be reset correctly. For the minus one eight seven E bin, this is thirteen point one two five nanoseconds, and for the minus one eight seven bin, it is fifteen nanoseconds.t R C, the A C T I V A T E to A C T I V A T E or Refresh command period, specifies the minimum interval between successive A C T I V A T E commands directed to different rows within the same memory bank, or between an A C T I V A T E command and a Refresh command to the same bank. This parameter ensures sufficient time for charge refreshing within the dynamic memory cells. Here, the minimum is fifty point six two five nanoseconds for minus one eight seven E and fifty two point five nanoseconds for minus one eight seven.t R A S, the A C T I V A T E to P R E C H A R G E command period, defines the minimum time a row must remain open after an A C T I V A T E command before a P R E C H A R G E command can be issued to that row. This period is directly related to the refresh requirements of the D R A M cells. The minus one eight seven E bin specifies thirty seven point five nanoseconds or nine times the t R E F I period, with a corresponding maximum of nine times t R E F I. The minus one eight seven bin shows identical timing constraints.The table also details C A S Latency, or C L, and Column Write Latency, or C W L, settings, which are critical for synchronous memory protocols. C A S Latency refers to the number of clock cycles between the memory controller issuing a column access command and the first bit of data being available from the memory device. Column Write Latency is analogous, but for write operations. These are presented in conjunction with clock cycles, denoted as t C K. For C L equal to five, supported C W L settings include t C K average, which is reserved, and t C K average, which requires three point zero to three point three clock cycles, with corresponding notes indicating possible dependency on operational temperature and system configuration.For C L equal to six, the C W L settings vary. When C W L is five, t C K average is reserved, and when C W L is six, t C K average is reserved. The note for these configurations implies that for specific t C K values, both C L and C W L requirement settings must be met.When C L is seven, C W L five requires one point eight seven five nanoseconds or less than two point five clock cycles, with the system noting it as reserved. C W L six is also reserved. Similarly, for C L equal to eight, C W L five requires one point eight seven five nanoseconds or less than two point five clock cycles, and C W L six is one point eight seven five nanoseconds or less than two point five clock cycles, with a note indicating that reserved settings are not permissible.The table concludes by listing supported C L settings as five, six, seven, and eight, and supported C W L settings as five and six. These supported combinations define the operational envelope for timing configurations of the D D R three to one O six six memory. The notes clarify that t R E F I is dependent on operating temperature, and that when specific t C K values are selected, both C L and C W L requirement settings must be fulfilled. Note three explicitly states that reserved settings are not allowed, reinforcing the strict adherence to specified operational parameters.Furthermore, the interpretation of Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, fields is crucial for understanding memory module configurations. Specifically, S P D Field fourteen and fifteen pertain to C A S Latencies Supported, while S P D Field zero times ten represents C A S Latency Time, often abbreviated as t A A min or t C L. The process of determining the actual C A S Latency Time involves retrieving a value from the S P D specification and dividing it by the Medium Timebase Divisor.In an example using a Micron M T four one J two five six M eight S D Ram chip, the datasheet indicates a t C L value of thirteen point one nanoseconds. However, the S P D specification itself mandates that this value must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which is specified as zero point one two five nanoseconds. The calculation yields one hundred point four eight, which is then rounded up to one hundred and four, and represented in hexadecimal as zero times sixty nine.This byte defines the minimum C A S Latency in Medium Timebase units, allowing software to determine the optimal cycle time for a particular module. The value comes from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet, and bits seven to zero represent the Minimum S D Ram C A S Latency Time, t A A min, in M T B Units, with values defined from one to two hundred fifty five. If t A A min cannot be divided evenly by the M T B, this byte must be rounded up to the next larger integer, and the Fine Offset for t A A min used for correction to get the actual value.Examples illustrate the calculation process, demonstrating how the minimum C A S Latency is determined for different D D R three modules, such as D D R three eight hundred, D D R three eight hundred E, and D D R three one thousand and sixty six E. The minimum C A S Latency is a crucial parameter in synchronous dynamic random access memory modules, dictating the number of clock cycles required between the assertion of the C A S signal and the availability of the data. Software can leverage this information, in conjunction with the C A S Latencies supported, to ascertain the optimal cycle time for a particular memory module, facilitating system configuration and performance optimization.
