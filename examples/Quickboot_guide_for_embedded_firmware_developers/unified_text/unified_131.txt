The P C I E port disable algorithm is a critical component in managing the functionality of specific P C I E ports. This algorithm involves detecting conditions that lead to the function disabling of a P C I E port, including card detection and initialization flows over P C I E, such as N A N D operations. It is essential that all these detected events are consolidated and processed within a singular P C I E enumeration cycle.The Manageability Engine, often referred to as M E, is a dedicated security processor subsystem and an offload engine integrated within the Platform Controller Hub, or P C H. There exist two primary S K U s for this firmware, namely a one point five megabyte S K U and a five point zero megabyte S K U. The five point zero megabyte S K U is specifically associated with advanced security features, such as Intel Active Management Technology. This particular five point zero megabyte firmware necessitates a setup option R O M that is identified as the Manageability Engine B I O S Extension, or M E B x. Historically, up until two thousand eleven, this extension ran on every boot cycle, contributing to boot time. Furthermore, M E slash B I O S interactions during the boot process were prevalent, irrespective of the specific firmware S K U utilized.The elimination of M E B x execution on every boot cycle is a notable development. Starting with platform controller hubs from two thousand twelve, the Intel P C H five point zero megabyte version effectively removes the necessity for M E B x execution during Fast Boots. Consequently, instead of running M E B x on every boot, it is now executed only as required, contingent upon the Uniform Extensible Firmware Interface, or U E F I flag. This shift signifies a more efficient boot process by deferring M E B x operations until they are functionally indispensable.In addition to the two thousand twelve M E B x optimization, starting in two thousand twelve platforms, during normal boot there are only two architecturally defined sync points between M E and B I O S remaining. One, Device Initialization Done, or D I D, happens as soon as memory is available for M E use following M R C initialization. The time is estimated to be between fifty milliseconds and one hundred twenty milliseconds after T S C starts, depending on the M R C and C P U requirements. Two, End of P O S T, or E O P, happens before a B I O S process boot list, at the end of D X E phase. It is estimated to be seven hundred milliseconds after T S C starts.All other M E B I O S communication will happen asynchronously outside of these two sync points, that is, no waiting for the other execution engine. The M E B x module is not expected to be called in a typical B I O S boot. If it is needed, it can be called via the exception handling methodology defined in Intel Fast Boot framework. Within the Fast Boot framework, S M B I O S, P C I Asset, and A S F tables are always updated and passed to the M E Intel A M T firmware, five megabytes in size, regardless of boot mode.For the media table, the B I O S will enumerate all storage controllers and attached devices during full boot and upon request by the Intel A M T firmware. Upon detecting an Intel A M T firmware request, B I O S will enumerate all media, except U S B, devices to generate and pass the media table. The heuristic on how frequent Intel A M T will request this is the responsibility of the Intel A M T design. U S B Flash Drive Provisioning for Intel A M T is supported only in full boot mode. By definition, any type two or type three exceptions will cause the B I O S to fall back into full boot mode. For example, one mechanism is when a user interrupts the boot processing by a hot key, stalling the boot; an exception will be triggered. If B D S phase is in full boot mode, a U S B stick provisioning of Intel A M T will need to function as expected.The graphics subsystem is another critical component, where graphics device selection plays a vital role. When looking at video and graphics devices, the panel timings are important, as are the controller timing and speed, which impact boot speeds. The timing numbers can be modified if required to help achieve faster boot speeds in a B M P utility on the U E F I G O P driver. A U E F I Graphics Output Protocol driver will provide faster boot speeds than a legacy video B I O S. Finally, a single graphics solution will be faster to boot than a multiple display/controller configuration. The U E F I Graphics Output Protocol, or G O P, support for C S M Free Operating Systems is also a key aspect, ensuring efficient and rapid system initialization.
