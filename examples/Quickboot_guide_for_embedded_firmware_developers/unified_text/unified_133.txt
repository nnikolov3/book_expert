The discussion begins by addressing the critical need for parallelizing delays during hardware initialization, particularly for display panels. A display panel requiring three hundred milliseconds to power up necessitates an equivalent delay in the power-up sequence of the embedded DisplayPort or eDP interface. This synchronization is crucial because the eDP port itself needs to be enabled, which involves a power-up sequence that can take up to three hundred milliseconds, and this operation must complete before the video module can be reliably utilized, typically during the Basic Input/Output System or BIOS phase of the boot process.In the context of storage subsystems, spinning media storage devices, such as traditional hard disk drives, are characterized by mechanical platters that spin to allow data access. The inherent nature of these devices means they have a spin-up time, which is stated as a minimum of two seconds. This mechanical latency means that even if the BIOS successfully initializes the system and gains control, the hard drive might not yet be ready to provide data, leading to a potential delay in the overall system responsiveness. In contrast, Solid-State Drive or SSD NAND drives do not physically spin up, but their readiness is determined by complex wear-leveling algorithms and databases that track data, which can take hundreds of milliseconds.The Intel Platform Controller Hub or PCH integrated Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or SATA controller supports Nonblocking Command Queuing, also known as NCQ, which allows the storage device to reorder incoming read and write commands to minimize head movement and rotational latency, thereby improving overall I/O performance. Unless required by the target operating system, the BIOS should access the storage subsystem in the most efficient way possible, such as using Advanced Host Controller Interface or AHCI mode, which typically incorporates NCQ.In client platforms, the disk feature of power-up in standby or PUIS is often disabled, meaning that upon a COMRESET command, the storage device will spin up. This spin-up is ideally performed as early as possible, typically at the Pre-EFI Initialization or PEI phase of the boot process. For SATA SSDs, the wear-leveling algorithms and databases required to track data can take hundreds of milliseconds before data is ready to be fetched, including identifying drive data. This latency can be mitigated by SSD firmware enhancements or controller augmentations designed to store this readiness state.The Intel Rapid Storage Technology or RST Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI driver is designed to enable SSD caching for slower hard disk drives, significantly improving read and write operations and spin-up readiness. This optimized UEFI driver is a component of the Compatibility Support Module or CSM-free Class Two and Class Three UEFI boot mechanisms, which eliminates the primary time-saving aspect of CSM. The driver adheres to the UEFI flag for Fast Boot and informs the UEFI option ROMs via the UEFI boot mode flag for any drive configuration changes.In Single Disk RAID 0 or SDRO configurations, the Intel RST driver facilitates caching, further enhancing performance. The driver does not wait for the Hard Disk Drive or HDD to spin up, allowing data access to the Operating System or OS boot loader as soon as cached data in the SSD is available. The fastest HDD takes about one point four to three seconds from power-up to data availability, which is far slower than the eight hundred milliseconds power-up to data availability on Intel SSDs.To minimize USB latency, the BIOS can be optimized for integrated components, such as the Intel integrated USB host controller and hubs, by replacing the default USB specification timing with Intel PCH USB timing. This can cut down the minimum time needed to enumerate all USB ports by more than half, from approximately four hundred fifty milliseconds.Finally, power management is crucial in extending battery life during runtime. Active State Power Management or ASPM is recommended on several buses in the platform, but it introduces nonzero latency. By understanding and optimizing these aspects of system initialization and power management, significant improvements can be made to overall system performance and efficiency.
