General Purpose Input/Output, or G P I O, configuration is a crucial aspect of platform extensibility, allowing for flexible adaptation to specific hardware requirements. G P I Os can be configured for either input or output, and some can also be configured for native functionality, depending on weak or strong pull-up or pull-down resistors. Certain G P I Os can act like strapping pins, which are sampled during the reset sequence by the chipset and can provide a secondary meaning for the system's initial configuration or runtime behavior. For instance, G P I O twenty-seven is utilized for such purposes on many mainstream platforms.System-on-chip devices often incorporate a significant number of G P I Os, providing a rich set of capabilities. This large quantity of pins is necessary because multiple functions can be multiplexed onto a single physical I O pin. Before a pin can be used, its configuration must be set, typically through system firmware. This configuration determines whether the pin will serve as a general-purpose I O pin or be dedicated to a specific function. In the context of general-purpose I O, these pins can be directed to control logic or behavior within the device, acting as either input or output ports. G P I O control registers are the mechanism through which this status and control are managed. System firmware developers must interact with a range of sixty-four to two hundred fifty-six G P I Os, often in conjunction with the board designer, who determines the specific options and configurations available on a per-platform basis to ensure proper feature enablement.Interrupt Controllers are critical components in managing asynchronous events within a system. Intel architecture employs various methods for interrupt handling, including the Programmable Interrupt Controller, or P I C, and the Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller, or A P I C. The P I C is the simplest mode, where it handles all interrupts, often utilizing a single thread of execution. The Basic Input/Output System, or B I O S, plays a crucial role in configuring the interrupt request lines, or I R Qs, for various devices, including those integrated onto the motherboard, expansion cards, and add-in P C I devices.The system described employs two cascaded eight two five nine s, which collectively provide fifteen available I R Qs. Notably, I R Q two is designated for connecting to the second eight two five nine, enabling a higher number of interrupt sources. Modern system architectures often feature a Platform Controller Hub, or P C H, which enumerates eight P I R Q, or P C I Interrupt Request, signals, denoted as P I R Q [A sharp : H sharp]. These signals facilitate interrupt routing from P C I devices to the interrupt request lines of the cascaded eight two five nine s. The specific routing of these P I R Q signals is governed by dedicated P I R Q Routing Registers, which reside within the memory-mapped I O space. The P C H also connects these eight P I R Q signals to eight individual I O x A P I C input pins, illustrating a more sophisticated interrupt delivery mechanism.Figure nine point four illustrates the Platform Controller Hub, or P C H, P I R Q to I R Q router. The diagram shows P I R Q pins on the left, which connect to P I R Q routing registers. These registers hold values, such as hexadecimal sixty h for P I R Q A sharp, and hexadecimal sixty-one h for P I R Q B sharp, hexadecimal sixty-two h for P I R Q C sharp, and hexadecimal sixty-three h for P I R Q D sharp. The P I R Q pins also connect to the I O A P I C through different interrupt request lines. Specifically, P I R Q A sharp connects to I N T I N sixteen, P I R Q B sharp connects to I N T I N seventeen, P I R Q C sharp connects to I N T I N eighteen, P I R Q D sharp connects to I N T I N nineteen, P I R Q E sharp connects to I N T I N twenty, P I R Q F sharp connects to I N T I N twenty-one, P I R Q G sharp connects to I N T I N twenty-two, and P I R Q H sharp connects to I N T I N twenty-three.Table nine point two details the Platform Controller Hub, or P C H, P I R Q routing table. The table has three columns: P I R Q sharp Pin, Interrupt Router Register for P I C, and Connected to I O X A P I C Pin. For the P I R Q sharp Pin column, it lists P I R Q A sharp, P I R Q B sharp, P I R Q C sharp, and P I R Q D sharp. The Interrupt Router Register for P I C column shows D thirty-one colon F zero colon Reg sixty h for P I R Q A sharp, D thirty-one colon F zero colon Reg sixty-one h for P I R Q B sharp, D thirty-one colon F zero colon Reg sixty-two h for P I R Q C sharp, and D thirty-one colon F zero colon Reg sixty-three h for P I R Q D sharp. The Connected to I O X A P I C Pin column shows I N T I N sixteen for P I R Q A sharp, I N T I N seventeen for P I R Q B sharp, I N T I N eighteen for P I R Q C sharp, and I N T I N nineteen for P I R Q D sharp.The text also mentions Messaged Signaled Interrupts, or M S I, as an alternative interrupt mechanism, suggesting a transition towards more advanced interrupt handling strategies that leverage messages rather than dedicated hardware lines for interrupt notification. The Input/Output Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller, or I O x A P I C, is another critical component in managing interrupts, providing a more sophisticated interrupt delivery mechanism. The P C H connects the eight P I R Q signals to eight individual I O x A P I C input pins, enabling a more efficient and flexible interrupt handling system.
