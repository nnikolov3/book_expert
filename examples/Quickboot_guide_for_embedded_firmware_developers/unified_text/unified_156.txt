The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, data structure of D D R three Dual In-Line Memory Modules, or D I M M s, contains specific bytes that define the timing characteristics of the memory. These bytes are crucial for determining the Medium Timebase, or M T B, which is a fundamental time unit used for calculating memory timings. The M T B is typically the greatest common divisor of clock periods for the supported range of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or S D Ram, frequencies.Bytes ten and eleven in the S P D data structure are used to encode the M T B. Byte ten, known as the Medium Timebase Dividend, and byte eleven, the Medium Timebase Divisor, are used together to establish the M T B value in nanoseconds. This value is used as a multiplier or divisor in conjunction with other timing values to derive specific delays and pulse widths required by the memory interface. For example, the M T B value can be used to calculate the minimum cycle time, or t C K minimum, which is a critical parameter in S D Ram performance.The calculation of t C K minimum involves dividing the lowest t C K number in the S D Ram datasheet by the Medium Timebase Divisor. This result is then represented in hexadecimal and stored in S P D field twelve. The t C K minimum value applies to all applicable components on the module and reflects the overall capabilities of the D D R three S D Ram and its support components.In cases where t C K minimum cannot be divided evenly by the M T B, the value must be rounded up to the next larger integer, and the Fine Offset for t C K minimum, stored in S P D byte thirty-four, is used for correction to obtain the actual value. This ensures accurate calculation of the minimum cycle time, which is essential for reliable memory operation.The table illustrating the relationship between the Dividend, Divisor, and resulting Timebase in nanoseconds shows that different clock frequencies correspond to specific Timebase values. For instance, a Dividend of one and a Divisor of eight yield a Timebase of zero point one two five nanoseconds, which is used for clock frequencies ranging from four hundred to one thousand and sixty-six megahertz.Furthermore, the S P D field twelve, which defines the S D Ram Minimum Cycle Time, or t C K minimum, is encoded in M T B units. This value is significant as it applies to all compatible S D Ram and support components on the memory module, reflecting the overall capabilities of the D D R three S D Ram and its support components. The table detailing the S P D field twelve shows that the typical value is zero x zero F, which translates to one point eight seven five nanoseconds.The encoding scheme used for t C K minimum allows for compact representation of critical timing information necessary for system initialization and configuration. The use of M T B units and the Fine Offset for t C K minimum enables accurate calculation of the minimum cycle time, ensuring reliable memory operation across various clock frequencies.In addition, the table showing t C K minimum values based on different parameters illustrates the relationship between t C K minimum, M T B, and the Fine Offset. For example, for a t C K minimum value of twenty, the M T B is zero point one two five, and the Fine Offset is zero, resulting in a t C K minimum of two point five nanoseconds, which is used for D D R three eight hundred at a four hundred megahertz clock.Similarly, for a t C K minimum value of fifteen, the M T B is zero point one two five, and the Fine Offset is zero, resulting in a t C K minimum of one point eight seven five nanoseconds, which is used for D D R three one thousand sixty-six at a five hundred thirty-three megahertz clock. This demonstrates how the M T B and Fine Offset are used to calculate the actual t C K minimum value, ensuring accurate memory timing and reliable operation.Overall, the S P D data structure and the calculation of t C K minimum are critical components of D D R three memory technology, enabling accurate memory timing and reliable operation across various clock frequencies. The use of M T B units and the Fine Offset for t C K minimum allows for compact representation of critical timing information, ensuring efficient system initialization and configuration.
