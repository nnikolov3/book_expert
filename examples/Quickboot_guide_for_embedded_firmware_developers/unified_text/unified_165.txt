The determination of the Minimum Row Active to Row Active Delay, denoted as tRRDmin, is a critical parameter in the context of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or SDRAM. This value is extracted from the datasheet of the specific SDRAM chip and then divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor. For instance, the tRRD value found in the Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet is seven point five nanoseconds. This value is then divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which is zero point one two five nanoseconds, resulting in a value of sixty, represented in hexadecimal as three C.A table illustrates this calculation, showing the relationship between tRRD in Medium Timebase units, the Timebase in nanoseconds, and the resulting tRRD value in nanoseconds, along with a corresponding use case. For example, when tRRD is forty eight, the Timebase is zero point one two five nanoseconds, yielding a tRRD result of six point zero nanoseconds, often associated with DDR3-1333 memory with a one kilobyte page size. Similarly, sixty Medium Timebase units translate to seven point five nanoseconds for DDR3-1333 memory with a two kilobyte page size, and eighty Medium Timebase units result in ten nanoseconds for DDR3-800 memory with a one kilobyte page size. It is essential to note that tRRD is independent of operating frequency, indicating that the minimum number of clock cycles required for this timing parameter remains constant regardless of the clock speed.The table also presents Command and Address Timings, including the parameter "DQS, DQS# differential READ postamble," which refers to the setup and hold times for the data strobe signal and its inverted counterpart relative to the data transfer during a read operation. The symbol for this timing parameter is RPS T, and for DDR3-800 memory, the minimum RPS T is zero point three nanoseconds, with a maximum not specified. Another significant timing parameter detailed is "DLL locking time," which is five hundred twelve nanoseconds for DDR3-800, DDR3-1066, DDR3-1333, and DDR3-1600 memory.Furthermore, the document outlines various timing parameters and their corresponding values, including CTRL, CMD, ADDR setup to CK, CK pair, with setup times ranging from one hundred seventy five nanoseconds to three hundred seventy five nanoseconds, and minimum and maximum values specified in picoseconds. The minimum CTRL, CMD, ADDR pulse width is nine hundred picoseconds, with a minimum of seven hundred eighty picoseconds and a maximum of six hundred twenty picoseconds.The ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay, referred to as RCD, is noted as being found in the Speed Bin Tables, with a unit of nanoseconds. The PRECHARGE command period, RP, and the ACTIVATE to PRECHARGE command period, RAS, also reference the Speed Bin Tables, with units of nanoseconds. The ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE command period, RC, has a minimum value that is the greater of four clock cycles or ten nanoseconds, with varying values for different page sizes. The FAW or four ACTIVATE windows parameter has values of forty picoseconds, thirty seven point five picoseconds, and thirty picoseconds.Additionally, the data presents values for WR and WTR, which represent write recovery time and write delay from start of internal write transaction to internal read command, respectively. For WR, the minimum is fifteen nanoseconds, and for WTR, the minimum is the greater of four clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds. The READ-to-PRECHARGE time, RTI, has a minimum value that is the greater of five clock cycles or seven point five nanoseconds. The CASH to CASH command delay, CCD, has a minimum value of eight clock cycles, and the Auto precharge write recovery plus precharge time, DAL, has a minimum value of WR plus RP divided by CKE. The MODE REGISTER SET command cycle time, MRD, has a minimum value of five clock cycles, and the MODE REGISTER SET command update delay, MOD, has a minimum value that is the greater of twelve clock cycles or fifteen nanoseconds.
