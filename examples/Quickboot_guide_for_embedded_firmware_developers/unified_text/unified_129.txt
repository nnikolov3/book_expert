The initialization of Application Processors, or A P s, in a multico re, multithreaded C P U architecture involves replicating memory ranges and other C P U configurations across all A P s. The optimal approach for this process is C P U specific, but general guidelines exist. Firstly, microcode updating, Memory Type Range Registers, or M T R R, and other operations should be parallelized to operate concurrently on each logical core. Secondly, synchronization overhead must be minimized by employing the most efficient method tailored to the specific C P U microarchitecture. Finally, execution should originate from memory and not from the Serial Peripheral Interface, or S P I, if possible, to leverage faster memory access.All Basic Input Output System, or B I O S, code must reside in cache for execution in a cache enabled state. This applies across all phases of the B I O S operation. The implication is that unless an explicit cache flush operation is invoked, typically for security reasons or to ensure data integrity, subsequent accesses to the same S P I address should result in a cache hit. This highlights the critical role of the C P U cache in B I O S performance, as detailed in the reference to "E D K two I I Performance Optimization Guide – Section eight point two."The efficiency of a system's boot process is intrinsically linked to its memory configuration. Specifically, higher memory frequencies contribute to faster boot times. This is analogous to how a faster processor enhances overall computational speed. The complexity of the memory system's physical makeup also plays a role; simpler configurations generally lead to faster boots. Furthermore, the number of memory banks affects performance. While a larger number of banks might seem beneficial, if the memory's overall size is constrained, a smaller number of banks, especially when paired with high-bandwidth memory technology, can result in a more agile memory footprint and improved runtime performance.The advent of fast and safe memory initialization is a significant advancement, particularly with Intel Core series C P Us since two thousand and ten. This capability streamlines the typical boot process. Initially, when a new memory module or processor is installed, the first boot involves an involved and time-consuming memory training algorithm. This process is crucial for tuning parameters, such as those for D D R three memory. However, with fast memory initialization, significant portions of this memory training can be bypassed, leading to a considerably reduced boot time. The Memory Controller Hub, or M R C, is designed to support three primary flows for fast memory initialization.The first flow, termed "Full slow memory initialization," is executed when the C P U and memory configuration are new and have not been previously detected by the system. This process establishes the memory timing points, ensuring correct operation. The second flow, "Fast memory initialization," is employed when the C P U and memory modules have not undergone changes since the last boot. In this scenario, the system utilizes previously saved settings, significantly accelerating the initialization process. The third flow is "Warm reset." This flow is invoked when power has not been removed from the D I M Ms, such as during a platform reset or after an S three sleep state resume.These three distinct flows can be utilized in conjunction with Fast Boot states. Importantly, they can also operate independently, providing flexibility in how the system's memory is initialized within the context of the main Fast Boot U E F I flag settings. This tiered approach to memory initialization optimizes boot performance based on the system's current state and configuration changes. Additionally, hardware-based memory clearing offers a performance advantage by utilizing specialized hardware capabilities, often integrated into the memory controllers themselves, to zero out memory. This is contrasted with software-based memory overwrites, which are inherently more time-consuming, typically adding seconds to the system's boot time.Moreover, starting with the Sandy Bridge generation C P U, new C P U instructions have been introduced to accelerate string operations, which is beneficial for memory operations such as clearing large buffers. For more detailed information on this topic, one can refer to the "E D K II Performance Optimization Guide – Section eight point five." Furthermore, optimizations to the S M Bus, which is used for memory initialization, can also contribute to improved boot times. The P C H S M Bus controller operates at one hundred K H z and has one data address lane. There are three methods to read data from the S M Bus: S M Bus Byte Read, S M Bus Word Read, and S M Bus Block Read, although the latter is not explicitly mentioned here. The S M Bus Byte Read requires a minimum of thirty-nine bits, resulting in a read time of at least zero point three nine milliseconds. In contrast, the S M Bus Word Read, which involves forty-eight bits, is more efficient, with a read time of zero point two four milliseconds per byte, representing a forty percent improvement over byte reads. However, the sequential nature of the data to be read can impact the efficiency of word reads during full boots.
