The DDR3-1066 speed bin is characterized by specific timing parameters, including CAS Latency (CL), Random Column to Row Delay (RCD), and Row Precharge (RP) timings. Two speed bin configurations are highlighted: one with CL, RCD, and RP timings of 7-7-7, and another with timings of 8-8-8. The timing parameters for these configurations are detailed in tables, which provide minimum and maximum values for various parameters, including ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay time, PRECHARGE command period, and ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE or Refresh command period.For the 7-7-7 configuration, the minimum ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay time is 13.125 nanoseconds, with no maximum specified. The PRECHARGE command period has a minimum of 13.125 nanoseconds, also with no maximum specified. The ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE or Refresh command period has a minimum of 50.625 nanoseconds and a maximum of 52.5 nanoseconds. In contrast, the 8-8-8 configuration has a minimum ACTIVATE to internal READ or WRITE delay time of 15 nanoseconds, with no maximum specified. The PRECHARGE command period has a minimum of 15 nanoseconds, again with no maximum specified. The ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE or Refresh command period has a minimum of 50.625 nanoseconds and a maximum of 52.5 nanoseconds.The tables also detail the relationship between CAS Latency (CL), Clock Write Latency (CWL), and their impact on specific memory states, particularly the 'CK (AVERAGE) requirements. Various combinations of CL and CWL values are listed, alongside their corresponding minimum and maximum timings in nanoseconds. For instance, when CL is 5 and CWL is 5, the memory requires 3.0 to 3.3 clock cycles for both speed bins. When CL is 6 and CWL is 5, the requirement is 2.5 to 3.3 clock cycles for the 7-7-7 bin, and 2.5 to 3.3 clock cycles for the 8-8-8 bin.The supported CL settings are 5, 6, 7, and 8 for the 7-7-7 bin, and 5, 6, and 8 for the 8-8-8 bin. The supported CWL settings are 5 and 6 for both speed bins. The notes section clarifies that tREFI depends on the operating temperature of the memory module, and that the CL and CWL settings result in 'CK requirements when selecting specific values.The Serial Presence Detect (SPD) standard is also discussed, specifically focusing on fields related to DRAM timing parameters. The requirement that certain timing parameters, denoted by the Greek letter tau, such as CAS Latency (CL) and Column Write Latency (CWL), must be met is highlighted. A note indicates that reserved settings are not permitted.SPD Field 20 is designated for the "Minimum Row Precharge Delay Time," represented as tRPmin. This field is derived from a Micron MT41J256M8 datasheet. SPD Field 0x15 defines the "Upper Nibble of tRAS and tRC," which serves as the most significant nibble for both the Active to Precharge Delay (tRASmin) and the Active to Active/Refresh Delay (tRCmin). The document directs the reader to subsequent sections for determining the precise values of tRASmin and tRCmin, and then instructs to place the upper nibble of these results into this specific SPD field.A table is presented that maps a decimal byte index to its hexadecimal representation, a field name, a typical value, and a definition. Byte index 21, represented in hexadecimal as 0x15, is associated with the field name "Upper Nibble of tRAS & tRC." The typical value for this field is shown as 0x11, with the definition indicating a placeholder for the actual definition.The page further details the extraction of the Minimum Active to Precharge Delay, denoted as tRASmin, which is a critical timing parameter for Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). This parameter dictates the minimum time that must elapse between a row becoming active and a precharge command being issued. The value of tRASmin is often encoded within the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) memory module specification.Specifically, the SPD field at address 0x16, or SPD field 22, stores the Least Significant Byte (LSB) of the tRASmin value. The process of extracting this timing parameter involves reading a raw value from the SPD data and then applying a scaling factor determined by the Medium Timebase Divisor. For example, the tRAS value found in the Micron MT41J256M8-187E datasheet is 37.5 nanoseconds. This number must be divided by the Medium Timebase Divisor, which is 0.125 nanoseconds. The result is 300, which is 0x012C. The LSB, 0x2C, goes into SPD field 22 (0x16), and the lower nibble of the MSB, 0x01, goes into bits [3:0] of SPD field 21 (0x15).The table shows byte information for SPD field 22. Byte 22, represented as hexadecimal 0x16, is named "Min. Active to Precharge Delay (tRASmin) LSB." The typical value for this field is hexadecimal 0x2C, and its definition is 37.5 nanoseconds. This systematic breakdown illustrates how critical timing information for memory operation is encoded within the SPD structure, enabling system initialization and configuration of memory controllers.
