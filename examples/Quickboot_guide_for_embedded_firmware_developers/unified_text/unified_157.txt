The calculation of tCKmin, a critical timing parameter for memory devices, involves a rounding mechanism when the tCKmin value cannot be perfectly divided by the Memory Clock Period, or MTB. If there is a remainder after division, the result is rounded up to the next whole integer. This rounded integer, along with a Fine Offset for tCKmin, which is specified to be found in SPD byte 34, is then used for correction to determine the actual, precise tCKmin value.The accompanying table, labeled "Table 53 DDR3-1066 Speed Bins," provides empirical data illustrating this concept across various DDR3 memory frequencies. The columns detail tCKmin in both MTB units and nanoseconds, along with an offset value in Fine Time Base, or FTB, units and a corresponding value. Following this are the FTB in nanoseconds, the tCKmin Result in nanoseconds, and the intended use.For instance, the entry for DDR3-800, operating with a four hundred megahertz clock, has a tCKmin of two point five nanoseconds, derived from an MTB value of zero point one two five and an offset of zero. More illustrative is the row for DDR3-1066, running at five hundred thirty three megahertz. Here, the MTB is also zero point one two five nanoseconds. The table indicates a tCKmin in MTB units of fifteen, implying a calculated value. The offset is zero, and the resultant tCKmin is one point eight seven five nanoseconds.However, the context of the text emphasizes the rounding process. Consider the entries with non-zero offsets in FTB units, such as the row for DDR3-1866 operating at nine hundred thirty three megahertz. This entry shows an MTB value of zero point one two five nanoseconds, a tCKmin of nine in MTB units, an offset of negative fifty four in FTB units, which corresponds to hexadecimal one A two B, and a resulting tCKmin of one point zero seven one nanoseconds.Another example is DDR3-2133 at one thousand sixty seven megahertz, with an MTB of zero point one two five nanoseconds, a tCKmin of eight in MTB units, and an offset of negative sixty two FTB units, represented as hexadecimal one A two B, yielding a final tCKmin of zero point nine three eight nanoseconds. These examples highlight how the fine offset, represented in FTB units, allows for precise adjustment of the tCKmin value beyond what the integer MTB units alone can represent.The system likely calculates an initial tCKmin based on the MTB units and then applies the fine offset to achieve the final, accurate timing specification for each memory speed bin. The "Notes: 1. See SPD byte 34" reinforces that the fine offset, a key component for precise tCKmin determination, is stored in a specific location within the Serial Presence Detect, or SPD, data, a standard mechanism for memory modules to communicate their capabilities to the system.Furthermore, the document details the timing parameters for DDR3-1066 memory speed bins, specifically focusing on the '-187E' and '-187' variants with associated 'C L', 'R C D', and 'R P' values. The presented data quantifies critical timing relationships between various memory operations, measured in nanoseconds, which are fundamental to ensuring data integrity and system stability in high-speed memory interfaces.The table delineates several key timing parameters, including the 'ACTIVATE to internal R EAD or W RITE delay time', denoted by 'R C D', the 'PRECHARGE command period', represented by 'R P', the 'ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE or Refresh command period', denoted by 'R C', and the 'ACTIVATE to PRECHARGE command period', denoted by 'R A S'. These parameters are given for the '-187E' and '-187' bins, with specific minimum and maximum values in nanoseconds.Additionally, the table lists 'C L' and 'C W L' settings, which define the required 't C K' values. For a 'C L' of five, with 'C W L' as five, the 't C K' requirement is three point zero to three point three nanoseconds for both speed bins. The supported 'C L' settings for the '-187E' bin are five, six, seven, and eight, while for the '-187' bin, they are five, six, and eight. Similarly, the supported 'C W L' settings for the '-187E' bin are five and six, and for the '-187' bin, they are also five and six.The notes provide crucial context, clarifying that 't R E F I' is temperature-dependent and that specific 'C L' and 'C W L' setting combinations dictate the required 't C K' values. When selecting 't C K', both the 'C L' and 'C W L' requirements must be satisfied, highlighting the interdependency of these timing parameters in DDR memory operation and the need for careful configuration to maintain reliable performance.The Serial Presence Detect, or SPD, standard is also discussed, specifically focusing on SPD Field number twelve, related to cycle time, and SPD fields zero E and zero F, which define supported C A S Latencies for S D Ram. The supported C A S latencies can be found in the S D Ram datasheet, with each supported C A S latency having its bit set in fields fourteen and fifteen. The range is from C L equals four through C L equals eighteen, with one bit per possible C A S Latency. A one in a bit position means that C L is supported, a zero in that bit position means it is not supported. Since C L equals six is required for all DDR3 speed bins, bit two of SPD byte fourteen is always one. These values come from the DDR3 S D Ram datasheet.
