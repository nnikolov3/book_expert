The Serial Presence Detect, or S P D, standard plays a crucial role in enabling system firmware to discover and configure dynamic random access memory, or D Ram, modules. Within this standard, specific timing parameters are defined to ensure proper data integrity during read and write operations in a D Ram interface. One such parameter is S P D Field Number twenty six, which defines the "Minimum Internal Write to Read Command Delay Time," denoted as t W T R minimum. This parameter specifies the minimum number of clock cycles required between a write command and a subsequent read command, and its value is typically seventy five nanoseconds.Another critical parameter is S P D Field Zero x one B, which defines the "Min. Read to Precharge Command Delay," symbolized as t R T P minimum. This parameter dictates the minimum time interval between a read command and the subsequent precharge command. To obtain the actual timing value used by the system, the t R T P value found in the datasheet, such as the Micron M T forty one J two hundred fifty six M eight datasheet, must be divided by a "Medium Timebase Divisor." For instance, a t R T P value of seven point five nanoseconds divided by a Medium Timebase Divisor of zero point one two five nanoseconds yields a result of sixty, which is represented in hexadecimal as zero x three C.The S P D structure itself is a form of non-volatile memory on a D Ram module, containing information about the module's capacity, speed, voltage, and other configuration parameters. This information is essential for system initialization and optimal performance. The specific fields and their values, like t W T R minimum and t R T P minimum, are part of a larger set of timing parameters that define the complex operational envelope of modern D Ram devices, enabling the motherboard's memory controller to interact with the D Ram modules reliably at high speeds.In the context of Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D D R three S D Ram, Byte 27 of the S P D defines the minimum internal read to precharge command delay time, denoted as t R T Pmin. This timing parameter is critical for the correct operation of D D R three S D Ram. The value for t R T Pmin is expressed in Medium Timebase, or M T B, units, and is often derived from the D D R three S D Ram datasheet. Controller designers must consult this documentation to accurately determine the appropriate page size for these memory devices. At certain operating frequencies, a larger t R T Pmin value might be necessary than what is indicated in the S P D. For example, for D D R three minus eight hundred memory, the t R T Pmin is specified as four clock cycles.The specific bits that define this delay are Bits 7 through 0, which are internally interpreted as the Internal Read to Precharge Delay Time in M T B units, with values ranging from one to two hundred fifty five. An example is provided to clarify the conversion: when t R T P is set to sixty M T B units, corresponding to a hexadecimal value of zero x three C, and the timebase is zero point one two five nanoseconds, the resulting t R T P value is seven point five nanoseconds. This particular setting is applicable to all D D R three S D Ram speed bins.A crucial note is that the t R T P value is at least four D D R three clock cycles, or n C K, and this minimum is independent of the operating frequency. This detail is vital for ensuring stable memory operation across different performance profiles. The document further references S P D Field number twenty seven, which is explicitly titled "Minimum Internal Read to Precharge Command Delay Time (t R T Pmin)". This field's definition originates from the J E D E C D D R three S P D Specification.The provided table details various timing parameters for D D R three memory, categorized by D D R three speed grades: D D R three minus eight hundred, D D R three minus one thousand sixty six, D D R three minus thirteen thirty three, and D D R three minus sixteen hundred, with corresponding minimum and maximum values in clock cycles (C K) or picoseconds (p s) and nanoseconds (n s). The parameters listed include D Q S, D Q S number differential READ postamble, D L L locking time, address setup to C K, C K number timing, address hold timing from C K, C K number, minimum C T R L, C M D, A D D R pulse width, A C T I V A T E to internal READ or WRITE delay, P R E C H A R G E command period, A C T I V A T E to A C T I V A T E command period, and A C T I V A T E to A C T I V A T E minimum command period.For each of these parameters, the table provides specific values and notes, highlighting the importance of consulting the Speed Bin Tables for accurate information. The A C T I V A T E to A C T I V A T E minimum command period, in particular, has two categories based on page size: one kilobyte page size and two kilobyte page size. The timing for this parameter is the minimum of four clock cycles or a specified number of nanoseconds, depending on the D D R three speed grade. These timing parameters are essential for ensuring the reliable operation of D D R three S D Ram modules at high speeds, and their accurate configuration is critical for optimal system performance.
